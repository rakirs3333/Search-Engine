# Overview
This project is a sophisticated web scraper and search engine built with Python. It leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for natural language understanding and Apache Lucene for efficient, scalable information retrieval. Designed to provide accurate and relevant search results, this tool parses web content and indexes it in a way that users can query through a simple interface.

# Features
i)Web Scraping: Automatically scrapes web pages to collect data, which is then processed and indexed.<br />
ii)BERT Integration: Utilizes BERT for advanced natural language processing, enhancing the search engine's ability to understand and match user queries with relevant information.<br />
iii)Lucene-Based Indexing: Employs Apache Lucene for creating an efficient search index, allowing for fast and scalable searches.<br />
iv)User-Friendly Interface: Offers an easy-to-use interface for performing searches and viewing results.<br />
v)Customizable Search Parameters: Users can customize search queries based on various parameters to refine results
