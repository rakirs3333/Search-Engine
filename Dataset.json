{"title": "Aldon Smith wants to 'make the best' of his chance with Seattle Seahawks", "text": "\nRENTON, Wash. -- \n declined to answer questions Saturday about his pending legal case in Louisiana or how it might impact his availability this season with the \n.\n\"I can't comment on that right now,\" he said.\nIn his first interview since signing with the Seahawks in April, the 31-year-old pass-rusher had much more to say about his four seasons away from the NFL and his latest opportunity following last year's comeback with the \n.\n\"Every day I just try to get better, and as long as I keep that mentality and keep learning and keep developing, the sky is still the limit for me,\" he said. \"I feel like I still have a lot left in the tank and a lot to offer this game.\"\nSmith is getting his first chance to prove that to the Seahawks. He didn't take part in the their voluntary offseason program -- several of the team's veteran players skipped the majority of it as well -- and received an excused absence from their mandatory minicamp. Coach Pete Carroll said that was so Smith could get in shape, which he has since done.\nWearing the No. 99 he wore when he began his career with the divisional rival \n, Smith has been on the field for all three of Seattle's practices since the start of training camp and hasn't appeared limited. Early in Thursday's practice, he engaged a tackling sled, lifted it up and nearly flipped it over.\n\"He's made a good first impression about learning stuff,\" Carroll said. \"He's a very bright kid. ... He knows what's going on in the game, brings us experience and background and all of that. He's having no trouble picking things up. He's got a real style. He's always had this marvelous length and reach and hands and hand play, and you can just tell, he's got a strength and power to him that's really unusual.\"\nSmith set an NFL record with 33.5 sacks over his first two seasons and has 52.5 sacks in five seasons.\nNone of that means he is a lock to stick with the Seahawks. He was guaranteed only $137,500 on his one-year, minimum-salary deal. And he's more of a potential luxury than a necessity, given how loaded the Seahawks are with edge rushers, including veterans Carlos Dunlap, \n and Kerry Hyder as well as promising young players such as \n, \n and \n.\n\"It's going to be very competitive,\" Carroll said. \"I hope you can see it already. It already shows. But once we get into pads, I'm anxious to see where he stands with that.\"\n adds to the uncertainty. He faces potential legal and NFL discipline over an alleged second-degree battery in the New Orleans area in April. Smith was arrested after he was accused of choking a man unconscious during an altercation that began inside a coffee shop. According to the police report obtained by WWL-TV, Smith had confronted the man about marital issues the man was having with one of Smith's relatives.\nSeahawks general manager John Schneider said later in April that the team would \"let the legal process take its course.\" Smith is scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 24, though that date could be pushed back.\nThe Louisiana incident was the latest of \n, which have included multiple DUI arrests and a domestic-violence charge. Those incidents and others led the NFL to suspend Smith for parts of the 2014 and '15 seasons and from 2016 to 2019 for violations of its policies on personal conduct and substances of abuse.\nSmith was asked what he learned during his time away.\n\"That football is an opportunity that a lot of people don't get, and when you get opportunities in life, you should make the best of them,\" he said. \"There's a lot of people who wish that they could play this game, and I'm glad that I just got a chance to be able to do the things that I needed to do to get mentally right, that I could be in a position that when I came back, I could be focused and give it what I need to give it to play.\"\nSmith had five sacks in 16 games for Dallas, with three coming in one game against Seattle and all of them coming in the first half of the season. He felt he got too heavy and has since worked to get back to his preferred weight, which is around 270 pounds.\n\"I was kind of fat last year,\" he said.\nSmith stayed in a sober living home last season in Dallas and is doing so now in Seattle. He said his \"tremendous support staff\" helps him with his ongoing battle to remain sober.\n\"For me it was just making myself vulnerable and being willing to trust and lean on [those] people,\" he said. \"I've always had people that were there, but I would always try to carry everything on my shoulders. So letting people help me and accepting that help was a major game-changer.\"\nCarroll said Seattle felt comfortable signing Smith after \"a lot of homework\" and several conversations with him. Smith made a positive impression on Seahawks defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. when both were with the Raiders in 2015, which factored heavily into the decision.\nCarroll said Smith has demonstrated the vulnerability he talked about \"in that he was very open and very upfront and he said, 'I need some work right now; I need some help right now and it's going to take me a while to get this done and that done.' He was not trying to cover for himself. He didn't pull any punches on it at all and was very upfront, and it was most refreshing.\"\nCarroll said that while it's ultimately on Smith to remain sober, the Seahawks will support him \"every step of the way.\"\n\"I want him to succeed at this in the worst way, and I want him to come through and do what he needs to do, so we're going to give him every opportunity,\" Carroll said. \"The level of communication is very clear and he's been very open with us, and he's told us when things were harder than others and he's been upfront in that regard and that's helped us understand and believe and trust that he's working at it, and that it isn't easy and it's a lifelong commitment that he has to make.\n\"We really sense that the more we can support him, the more, obviously, we can be there for him, the stronger it makes him.

{"title": "How the Falcons use Bill Walsh fellowship to emphasize coaching diversity", "text": "\nTessa Grossman was about to get into her mother's white Mazda on May 3 when a notification popped up on her cell phone. Home in California for a couple of weeks after the spring semester of grad school at Illinois State, she saw whom the email was from and started getting nervous before she even opened it.\nFive days earlier, she completed a first interview with the \n for a Bill Walsh Diversity Coaching Fellowship during training camp. Her interviewers said they'd be in touch. This email from Sarah Hogan, Atlanta's assistant director of coaching operations, could be good news. Or bad.\nIt was good. Atlanta wanted a second interview.\n\"I remember sitting down in the car and going, 'Oh my god, the Falcons just emailed me for a second interview,'\" Grossman said. \"Basically, like, holy s---, this is crazy.\"\nIt's not too late to play with friends and family. Draft a league now and start fresh with a 0-0 record and a shortened schedule. New league weeks start every Thursday with TNF kickoff. \nShe took a deep breath. She had to plan to impress one more time. The email said to pick an interview time and Marquice Williams, Atlanta's special teams coordinator, would reach out with details.\nWhat started as a cold email to Hogan on April 10 introducing herself and informing Hogan she had applied for the fellowship led to Grossman's selection as one of eight finalists for four internship spots in a program designed to increase the number of NFL minority coaches.\nProcesses differ from team to team, but all across the country calls and emails like this occurred for candidates for the introduction to the NFL through participation in training camps or offseason workouts.\nIt's a competitive gig -- often, like Grossman, potential fellows have full-time or graduate assistant jobs in college or high school. Venessa Hutchinson, who helps run the program for the NFL, said approximately 1,000 people applied this year.\nMost years, the NFL has full participation. In Atlanta, this meant a comprehensive interview process run by Hogan and Williams, which whittled the Falcons' in-house database of 50 applicants to the four they selected: Grossman (strength and conditioning), Erick Capetillo (tight ends/running backs), Darryl Jackson (special teams) and Cliff Matthews (outside linebackers), a former Falcons player.\n\"The Falcons have been a team that has always been at the forefront,\" Hutchinson said. \"Even when the old regime was there, they were bringing in female coaches and things like that, a lot earlier than a lot of the other clubs.\n\"They were always trying to be more progressive.\"\nIn one of her first conversations after head coach Arthur Smith was hired by the Falcons this offseason, Hogan brought up the Bill Walsh program. She had been instrumental in its implementation under former coach Dan Quinn and wanted to continue.\nShe'd represented the Falcons at league meetings about the fellowship. She had plans. Smith agreed. The process became hers.\nThen she met with special team coordinator Williams, who received his NFL start with Bill Walsh fellowships in Chicago and Detroit. Hogan happened to have her database of potential candidates open. Williams asked about it. They discussed his experiences and how it helped his coaching growth.\n\"Right after that conversation [I told him] that, 'Hey, I talked to Coach [Smith] and I'm spearheading this thing. I'd love for me and you to do it together,'\" Hogan said. \"He was all for it. It made it so much better.\"\nIn years past, Hogan had worked with a member of the scouting department. Now, she'd be working with an assistant coach. She also implemented changes. Hogan had suggestions from her prior experience running the program. Williams had ideas from his own Bill Walsh experience.\nTogether they streamlined the process of name collection and took candidate suggestions from their coaching staff. They scoured the NFL database and did their own research. If someone -- like Grossman -- reached out cold and showed initiative beyond clicking the Falcons box on the NFL application, they received consideration.\nDue to the timing of the program with FBS training camps and wanting fellows to receive the full experience, they decided they wanted one high school coach, one small-college coach, an Ivy League coach and a fourth wild-card spot. They wanted a woman to fill at least one role. Each candidate was logged into Hogan's tabbed-out, color-coded database containing information for this year and future seasons.\nWilliams and Hogan communicated regularly through email, text, phone calls and in-person meetings. Any time an idea came up, they fired off a note, working a handful of hours each week for about a month outside of interviews on the program.\nUsing their metrics, they narrowed down their database to 16 candidates who would receive 25-minute first interviews by phone. From there, they selected eight candidates to participate in Zoom interviews with Hogan and Williams. If he could, Smith would sit in. Otherwise, he'd watch recordings later.\n\"We wanted someone who is a total go-getter, who would do anything and everything,\" Hogan said. \"They would wash jerseys. They would pick up equipment. It had to be someone who was really enthusiastic about the whole program and the idea of it and learning.\n\"Someone who could take what we were teaching them and take it back to their current job. We weren't necessarily looking for someone just to take the internship to put on their r√©sum√© to say that they did it.\"\nThat was important to Hogan and Williams because of how they came up through the NFL.\nHogan grew up around football. Her formative years were spent in Merrick, New York, where her father, Greg Gigantino, was Hofstra's defensive coordinator. The closest she came to playing or coaching was in eighth grade at Merrick Avenue Middle School, where she and her best friend considered trying out for football after their track season was moved to spring. But they decided not to.\nIn college at James Madison, she had no intention of working in football. Her father told her he helped land her a job in the football office. She didn't think anything of it, just that she'd be going to help people they'd known over the years.\n‚Ä¢ \n\n‚Ä¢ \n\n‚Ä¢ \n\n‚Ä¢ \n\n‚Ä¢ \nAt the time, she didn't know anything about football operations. She thought the only gig for women in sports was athletic training.\n\"And then I just kind of really liked doing it,\" Hogan said.\nHogan interned with the Jets -- the team held training camp at Hofstra -- and changed her major to sports management and kinesiology. She went to grad school at Georgia State for sports administration and became the director of football operations at Northeastern and then Georgia State.\nIn 2015, she landed with the Falcons as the coordinator of scouting administration. Eight months later, Quinn made her the coordinator of head coach operations and she's now essentially the deputy chief of staff assisting Smith and director of coaching operations Brian Griffin.\nShe works with various staff members to coordinate logistics and put everything together -- from rookie travel to the Bill Walsh program.\n\"We just carry out the head coach's wishes and make it easy for him to get his agenda and get the team ready to win games,\" Hogan said. \"That's my bottom line.\"\nIn working on the fellowship, she was also able to fulfill an objective she adopted from her father: taking interest in younger coaches and trying to match jobs with candidates. It's what she wanted to do: make a difference behind the scenes, ever since she moved from college to the NFL.\nWilliams could relate. Had it not been for the Bill Walsh program, he might not be where he is now.\nWilliams was a defensive line coach at South Dakota in 2013 when he wrote 32 letters -- one to each NFL head coach -- and mailed them along with a copy of his r√©sum√© and his business card.\nA Fresno, California, native and former defensive back at the University of Mary in North Dakota, he had few connections to the league. He'd spent time in small colleges -- Winona State, Central Oklahoma before South Dakota -- when he decided to apply for the fellowship program.\nHe figured the personal touch could stand out, perhaps catch the eye of application collectors. The extra effort worked. He landed with the Bears in 2013 and 2014 and then in 2015 with the Lions under Jim Caldwell.\nWorking with the Bears gave him his first exposure to special teams under coordinator Joe DeCamillis. With Caldwell he gained insight into almost everything.\n\"I learned more about different ways on teaching the values and different ways to practice on presenting certain topics,\" Williams said. \"Concepts and how to structure a practice, how to structure meetings. And Coach Caldwell did a great job of exposing us to the overall big picture of becoming a servant-leader.\"\nBefore Williams' Lions internship, Caldwell brought him for a two-hour interview. One hour was to interview as a linebackers coach and the other as a special teams coordinator. Williams thought it was for the internship, but Caldwell treated it like it was for a full-time job.\nEssentially, his internship began during the interview, where Caldwell asked about Williams' approach as a teacher and communicator, quizzed him about his personality, asked how he installed plays and ran practice. He inquired about special teams philosophy and how special teams complements offense and defense.\n\"That helped me and to this day I still use a lot of the tools that I learned from that interview and then the feedback I got from that interview,\" Williams said. \"When I interviewed with Coach Smith or whatever organization it may be, my base foundation came from that mock interview with Coach Caldwell.\"\nIn 2016, Williams became the assistant special teams coach with the Chargers and in 2018 was moved to a defensive assistant role. Then he spent two seasons back in Detroit under Matt Patricia as the assistant special teams coach before Smith hired him as his coordinator this year.\nIt started with the fellowship.\n\"It was a platform to show who I am as an individual and show what I could bring to the table, but the bigger thing was it gave me the opportunity to learn the game of football,\" Williams said. \"That's first and foremost.\"\nWhen Williams spoke with Grossman on May 5 to set up final interview parameters, he said half of the 20-minute final interview would be a presentation on anything she wanted. Drawing from a lesson learned from his interview with Caldwell, Williams wanted the candidates to teach him and Hogan something.\n\"They wanted you to install a play or something that I run in my offense,\" Capetillo said. \"And that was a little bit exciting, but also nerve-racking.\"\nCapetillo explained an inside run play his Las Vegas High team uses frequently with him as the head coach. Matthews, the defensive line coach at Reinhardt College, presented on the concepts of blocks defensive linemen might face and how to counter them.\nJackson, the special teams coordinator and defensive backs coach at Brown, did a brief introduction of himself followed by a replica of a directional punt coverage presentation he'd use at a meeting with his players.\nGrossman, an Illinois State strength and conditioning graduate assistant, practiced her presentation six times the morning of her May 6 interview. She talked about the concept of cognitive restructuring and the importance of positive self-talk over negative self-talk.\nWhile Capetillo, Matthews and Jackson had years of playing and coaching experience, Grossman had never held a full-time job. She graduated from Dartmouth a year ago, her senior softball season wiped out by the COVID-19 pandemic. She used material from her final presentation for Motivation and Sports last semester -- a presentation she got an A for -- in her interview with Hogan and Williams.\nThe four candidates were Hogan and Williams' first choices, and all four aced their final interviews.\nThe process worked. Hogan and Williams had their fellows. Williams and Hogan divided the calls to the candidates they chose not to hire -- but encouraged them to stay in touch and to apply again next year -- and the congratulatory calls.\nThere were reasons they chose to call the candidates they did: Capetillo was Williams' college teammate. Matthews had been to Flowery Branch before and Hogan was his liaison when he'd come to watch film. Jackson coached with Hogan's father. Only Grossman, who reached out to Hutchinson for preparation tips throughout the process, had been unknown to Hogan or Williams prior to the process.\nCapetillo, 32, was at his high school's track practice when Williams called. He stepped aside for a minute and had to contain his excitement. He'd applied for the program before, but this was the furthest he'd gotten in the process.\nHe already had spoken to his wife -- they were high school sweethearts -- about the possibility of being away from home for three weeks. His goal, his dream, has been to work for an NFL team. This would be the first step on his path.\nAfter he got off the phone, he quickly called his wife and went back to coaching track to unsuspecting kids who had no idea what just happened to their coach.\nJackson, 52, applied only to the Falcons. His connection with Hogan and his brother living in the Atlanta area made the Falcons an attractive possibility. He'd been part of the internship program before -- in 2007 with Jacksonville, 2003 with Detroit and 1999 with Philadelphia. He applied again not because he was looking for a way to the NFL, but to increase his knowledge base. He found out he got the job sitting in his office at Brown.\n\"It was time for me to branch back out,\" Jackson said. \"Re-network and learn at the highest level and have an opportunity to listen and work with coaches and players at that level.\"\nMatthews, 31, was in his suburban Georgia home working on his other passion: cooking. He was in the middle of making collard greens -- one of his specialties -- when Hogan called. Fancying himself a master chef, he kept cooking. When he hung up, he sat down, told his wife the news and called his head coach at Limestone to tell him.\nGrossman, 23, had been told after the interview to expect a call from Thomas Stallworth, Atlanta's head strength and conditioning coach. They spoke for an hour while Grossman, still on Pacific time, was in her bedroom. At the end, Stallworth let it slip the Falcons were offering her the fellowship -- followed by a call five minutes later from Williams making it official.\n\"It was just really shock at first,\" Grossman said. \"The whole experience felt like a bit of a fairy tale to be honest.\"\nShe had not expected this in her first attempt at applying, even though she interned with the Rams. Matthews and Capetillo had hoped for this since they entered coaching. For Jackson, it's a way to keep learning. It's an opportunity, a chance. All they need to do is look at Williams to understand where it could lead.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31739787/how-falcons-use-bill-walsh-fellowship-emphasize-coaching-diversity"},

All-Pro guard \n and reserve tackle \n were placed on the list on Saturday.\nReceiver \n is another starter who already was on the list, as is key reserve defensive tackle \n.\nWashington ranks next to last in terms of vaccination rate, having just climbed above 70% of players having at least one shot. One team remains below 70%. The overall player percentage in the NFL is 89.4, with 22 clubs over 90% and nine above 95%.\nAs of Saturday morning, Arizona had the most players on the reserve/COVID list with nine. The \n had four players along with head coach Frank Reich.\nBeing on the COVID list does not mean a player has the virus. It could be based on contact tracing. But even that would cost a player five days.\nAs Rivera told his players after practice Saturday, if this had been the day before the opener vs. the \n, then Scherff and Sharpe would also have missed the second game because it occurs on a Thursday.\n\"Those guys would not be eligible, so, to me, it brings the reality of what the rules are,\" Rivera said, \"and I hope it helps. But these young men have to make their decisions.\"\nFor now, Rivera said, it makes it hard to fully evaluate various players or units with players missing. Washington has wanted to use second-year lineman \n at guard, for example, but with both Sharpe and fellow tackle \n on the list, the team has mostly kept him outside.\n\"That's part of the problem, to be very honest,\" Rivera said. \"That's going to make things difficult, and that's the thing we have to be aware of. It'll make it difficult in terms of everybody working together, difficult on us as coaches with our evaluations and scouts, and it'll be difficult on the player because having time off, not really getting an opportunity to work and develop and grow and learning. That's the downfall and that's the downside.\"\nRivera said they've set up appointments for some players to get a shot Sunday, which is their day off. He said he has talked to a number of his players about their hesitation over getting the vaccine. Rivera said he tries to provide them with information about how the vaccine was developed.\n\"There is some deep thought going on from some of these guys,\" Rivera said. \"It's a matter of these guys being educated and understanding, because it's fair when you sit down and talk to these guys and listen to them and listen to their true concerns. Some guys just don't know, and I've gotten a sense that there are a few who are dug in so hard, so much that they're not going to back down. That's the part to me that's concerning because I care about all these guys. You do worry that somebody might catch it and go home and pass it on to a family member.\"\nOn Friday, Scherff, wearing a mask and 12 feet from the media, spoke about the vaccine.\n\"It's a personal decision for me; it's a personal decision for everybody,\" he said. \"Nobody's made a deal of it. You know, we're all here to play football and that's what we're doing.\"\nOn Tuesday, Rivera said he was \"beyond frustrated\" with the team's slow pace of vaccinations. He also said he was immune deficient because of cancer last fall.\n\"I think just making the statement that I'm immune deficient hopefully is part of their conversation, part of their thought process,\" Rivera said.\n\"It's a personal thing, but we can sway them hopefully.\"\nWashington had no players on its 53-man roster go on the COVID list last regular season. Two players, Ioannidis and running back Javon Leake, went on the list, but Ioannidis was on injured reserve and Leake was on the practice squad.", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/31928525/washington-football-team-coach-ron-rivera-warns-team-two-more-players-go-covid-19-list"},

She then turned in the performance of her life at the Olympic Trials, catapulting herself from fifth place in the final turn to third place -- the final spot on the Olympic team -- and finished with a personal best time of 53.70 seconds.\nThen on Friday, she put up a 55.37 in Heat 1 behind Colombia's Melissa Gonzalez (55.32), the wife of Lions backup quarterback \n, and Ukraine's Viktoriya Tkachuk (54.80).\n\"One of the things I say to Anna is, she's a five-star, she was a five-star recruit coming out of high school,\" Cockrell said. \"So I just tell her, 'Be a five-star. Just breathe and do it. ... Just breath, do it and let your light shine.'\"\nThe Cockrell siblings have been able to talk on the phone and trade text messages since she has been in Tokyo. On Saturday night, they exchanged grumblings over the weather. Japan's sweltering heat wave and stifling humidity caught her off guard, while the older Cockrell had just donned pads for the first time in a Tampa Bay training camp.\n\"We have good conversations about it, how to deal with performing at a high level,\" said Cockrell, who joined the Bucs as a free agent midway through last season. \"Being the older brother, I just love giving her as much advice as I can. I'm learning to listen more. It's one of the things I know I gotta work on with her. We just have good conversations. At the same time, we respect what each other [does] and when we need to give each other that space, we give each other that space.\"\nThe postponement of the Olympic Games due to the pandemic meant Anna would miss her senior year of competition at Southern Cal. Cockrell called it the \"longest year of my sister's life\" but said it helped her rejuvenate physically and mentally.\nIn a tearful postrace interview at trials, she opened up about battling depression in 2019 and wanting to quit the sport, which she has since gone into greater detail about due to an increased focus on athlete mental health at the Olympics.\n\"She's very talented,\" Cockrell said. \"She's a very beautiful person, inside and out.\n\"We're just tremendously thankful.

{"title": "Best Year 2 quarterback breakout seasons in NFL history: Could Trevor Lawrence, Zach Wilson, Trey Lance, Justin Fields, Mac Jones match?", "text": "\nFive quarterbacks were drafted in the \n of the \n. Four of them -- \n (Jaguars), \n (Jets), \n (Bears) and \n (Patriots) -- saw significant time as rookies. \n (49ers) had  only a couple of spot starts, but third-round pick \n eventually won a starting job with the Texans. In all, just over 12% of the pass attempts we saw in regular-season games last season were thrown by rookies.\nThose quarterbacks weren't very good. Out of 31 qualifying passers, four of the five first-round rookies ranked 26th or worse in \n. Jones was the only one who wasn't in the bottom six; he finished 16th in the league. Lance didn't play frequently enough to qualify, but it's clear this group of would-be standouts expects to take a step forward in 2022.\nThe good news for fans of these young passers is the Year 2 breakout practically has turned into an obligation. Over the past five seasons, we've seen two second-year passers win MVP awards, while a third was denied only by an injury. Another made the single largest leap we've ever seen from a second-year quarterback, while a fifth came within one drive of winning \n.\nWith six sophomore quarterbacks expected to serve as their team's starter heading into 2022, which one(s) will break out? To try to answer that question, I looked at notable Year 2 breakouts from years past to get a sense of what those quarterbacks looked like after their first seasons.\nComparing quarterbacks across eras isn't foolproof, and with passing stats at all-time highs, we need to measure players against their competitors as opposed to simply using raw stats. With that in mind, to contextualize passing performance, I'm using an indexed metric from Pro Football Reference called \n (ANY/A+).\nA better version of passer rating, ANY/A uses more accurate weights for touchdowns and interceptions while also incorporating yards lost on sacks. Then, the indexing places the stat on an easy-to-understand scale, making it so that a 100 ANY/A+ is a league-average performance in any given season. That means 115 would be a good season, and 130 would be an incredible campaign; likewise, an 85 ANY/A+ would be disappointing, while a 70 ANY/A+ would be a disaster.\nI'll hit eight second-year breakouts, going back nearly 40 years in the process. To start, let's begin with one of the most dramatic second-year campaigns in league history:\n Raw prospect takes a year to develop on the bench under an offensive genius before breaking out.\nIt seems bizarre to consider now, but there was a time when Mahomes wasn't regarded as a preternatural quarterback prospect, let alone as one of the best players on the planet. Opinions were mixed on him \n. The Bears famously chose \n ahead of the future Hall of Famer, and in Bob McGinn's poll of NFL scouts and executives before the draft, \n among quarterbacks, behind Trubisky and \n.\nThe Chiefs \n and took him with the No. 10 overall pick, but with \n entrenched as their starter, coach Andy Reid & Co. didn't rush the Texas Tech star into the lineup. Smith led the league in passer rating (104.7) and ranked second in yards per attempt (8.0), and the Chiefs left Mahomes on the bench for nearly all of his rookie season. The only game action he saw was in Week 17, when he played in what amounted to a \n, throwing for 284 yards with an interception.\nAfter clearing out a starting spot by \n, the Chiefs installed Mahomes as their starter in 2018. Mahomes had \n, but no one could have quite imagined what happened next.\nMahomes was a superstar by the end of September, as he threw for 896 yards and 13 touchdowns without an interception over his first three games. He finished the season with 5,097 passing yards and 50 touchdown throws, joining \n as the second quarterback in league history to join the 5,000 and 50 club. Mahomes' 136 ANY/A+ ranks as the 20th-best single-season mark in league history.\nContinue reading this article and more from top writers, for only $9.99/mo.\n\n                    \n                    \n\n                ", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/insider/story/_/id/34478901/best-year-2-quarterback-breakout-seasons-nfl-history-trevor-lawrence-zach-wilson-trey-lance-justin-fields-mac-jones-match"},

{"title": "Seahawks WR Doug Baldwin isn't sweating contract year", "text": "\nSeahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin says he isn't thinking about his contract situation, but he admits that he'd like to be paid No. 1 wide receiver money. (0:48)\nHOLLYWOOD -- This is not the \n who casual football fans know. Wearing gym shorts, a T-shirt and an easy smile while dining on a cheeseburger and fries in the lobby of the W hotel, the \n' leading wide receiver is relaxed, soft-spoken and introspective. There are no signs of Angry Doug, the alter ego who is quick to challenge reporters, teammates, coaches and management if he feels something or someone is out of line.\nAngry Doug might appear divisive to outsiders because of his willingness to speak his mind, but the sixth-year pro is embraced within a Seahawks organization that, under coach Pete Carroll, prides itself on allowing players to be themselves. For Baldwin, that means confronting every slight -- real and imagined.\n\"Doug Baldwin is what we are all about,\" says general manager John Schneider. \"He has been a heartbeat player since he entered the building.\"\nSchneider has every desire to keep Baldwin in the building well past 2016, the final year on his contract. Baldwin is coming off a breakout season in which he set career highs for catches (78), yards (1,069) and touchdowns (14), and his 11 aerial scores over the final six weeks were more than every other player and five \nBaldwin signed a $13 million, three-year extension in May 2014 that includes a base salary of $4 million this season. He clearly has outperformed that deal, but the likelihood of him receiving the contract of an elite No. 1 receiver seems remote because the Seahawks' success is built on a strong running game and a defense that has allowed the fewest points in the league each of the past four seasons.\nAngry Doug would have no problem arguing why he deserves a significant raise, but the Doug Baldwin who spoke calmly last month during lunch chose a more pragmatic approach.\n\"If I continue to work hard, if I continue to strive to get better and not focus on things money oriented, it's eventually going to come,\" he says of a new contract. \"And even if it doesn't, I'm fine with that, too, because at the end of the day, I'm controlling what I can control. That's all God gave me, was the tools to control what I can control. If it doesn't work out the way that I want it to work out, that to me is just God telling me that He has a better plan.\"\nThere seems a reasonable chance of an extension getting done this year because both sides want it to happen. Baldwin knows he is part of a special group of players, coaches and personnel people such as Schneider, whose rosters have produced four straight playoff appearances, including two trips to the Super Bowl and one championship. And the Seahawks know Baldwin's value cannot be completely measured by statistics, as last season attests.\nSeattle was teetering on missing the playoffs after a 4-5 start. The only consistency to their season was its inconsistency. Two losses were followed by two wins, then two losses by two more wins. A \n at home to Arizona left the Seahawks staggering and below .500 after nine games for the first time since 2011.\nThey were dealing with a hangover after losing the previous season's Super Bowl, a contract holdout the first two weeks by strong safety \n, struggles to involve tight end \n, who was acquired in a trade during the offseason, a decline in performance by the offensive line and quarterback \n, and an injury to workhorse running back Marshawn Lynch.\nSomething needed to be done. Something needed to be said. Baldwin was among those who challenged not only his teammates, but also Carroll and his staff.\n\"We weren't playing well, and a lot of what was being said [by players and coaches] wasn't being pointed enough or sharp enough,\" Baldwin says. \"It was like, \n and I'm thinking in my head: 'Nah, it's not OK. And it's not going to be OK until we get our stuff together.' A lot of the leaders in the locker room, we started being more vocal -- not only to players, but to coaches regarding the environment we were creating and the message we were sending. It took a while, but our play started reflecting how we wanted everybody to be.\"\nThe challenges were not just about culture, but also play design.\n\"I'm not afraid to say this, but Pete and I, we had heated debates on the sideline,\" Baldwin says. \"We had more debates on the sideline than in previous years. I want to help the team, and in my mind, as a receiver, you want the ball, you want opportunities to do things to help the team. I put my emotions out there to let it be known, and all the players will tell you, if you don't have a player like that, that can harness that in the right way, then they're not really worth anything. If I'm just out there, and I'm OK with us losing and not converting on third down, then what am I really there for? I'm just going through the motions.\"\nBaldwin's frustration stemmed not only from a lack of opportunities, but also with him not being a first or second option in some red zone passing situations. When offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell changed that, Baldwin's output soared. After catching only three touchdown passes in the first 10 games, he had 11 in the final six -- more than the Colts (10), Ravens (10), Falcons (8), Browns (8) and Cowboys (7) had during that time.\n\"Bevell and I -- we joke about it now -- but we got into a very heated argument that some players had to step in,\" Baldwin says. \"It's part of the game. If I could go back and handle it differently and act differently, I would. But I'm just very passionate about the game. ... Part of me wanted to go on a rant toward critics and say, 'I told y'all.' But another part of me -- the part that has the humility -- knows that my real goal and real focus is to try to win championships.\"\nThat's why Baldwin is realistic when it comes to 2016. He knows his opportunities likely will be limited, because the Seahawks figure to rely on a blueprint that has produced an average of 12 wins a year the past four seasons. That means running the ball and playing great defense. For the wideouts, glory is often in the sacrifice.\n\"We're going to go back to the run game; we're not going to be throwing the ball as much as we did,\" Baldwin said. \"That's why the only thing that I'm keyed in on is making sure that I stay as efficient as I was. Like, catch rate. If the ball is thrown my way, if it's a catchable target, do I catch it? I think last year I had only two drops maybe. I want to continue that path. I know everybody is going to talk about the raw numbers, but I'm not going to get the raw numbers. I'm not going to get 120 catches a season. That's not built into our offense. What I am going to get are chances on third down, so I'm going to make the best of those when I get them. I have to measure myself against them.\"\nThe Stanford alumnus led all receivers over the final six weeks with 225 yards on third down. Four of those catches went for scores, matching his total over the previous 72 games. Will that be enough to get him an extension befitting someone who tied for the league lead with 14 touchdown catches last season? And if so, will it come sooner than later?\nChill Doug isn't stressing over it.\n\"I didn't sign my new deal until almost June last time, so the offer is going to come,\" he says. \"John pretty much told me that the offer was going to come after the draft. Even if it doesn't come, I'm not worried about it. Why not? Because there are other things I value in life. I don't value worrying about that.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/15530243/seattle-seahawks-intend-keep-angry-doug-baldwin-nfl-contract-year"},

{"title": "Love/Hate for 2016 NFL draft: Big win for Elliott, tough spot for Goff", "text": "\nI always ask people to just download our podcast. \"We don't care if you listen,\" I say...\"We just want the clicks.\"\nThis is true. But the people, well, sometimes they ignore me and actually listen. And those who do listen know that I hate answering keeper questions during the offseason.\nMy advice is to wait until the last possible minute to make a keeper selection because fantasy value changes all the time -- every day, in fact, based on health, role, team, coaching, scheme and so many other factors. And never was that more evident than at the NFL draft, where many players saw their fantasy stock rise or fall based on what their teams did.\nSo here, now, is a quick NFL draft edition of \"Love / Hate.\" These are not necessarily guys I love or hate for the upcoming season, but rather players whose value went up (\"loves\") as a result of the NFL draft or players whose value went down (\"hates\") because of what their team did. This is by no means comprehensive, but rather just the highlights I noted as I watched the draft unfold.\n Just because it's obvious doesn't mean it isn't true. The short hand is he's a stud running back who is also a terrific blocker, running behind one of the best lines in football. The Cowboys are the only team that has a current streak with a RB who has run for 1,000 yards while totaling 300 receiving yards in consecutive seasons. They've done it three straight years, in fact, or every season since starting center \n was drafted. I mean, hell, \n, who didn't get more than 10 carries in a game until Week 7 last year, and was running with one of the worst offenses in football (no \n or \n for most of it), STILL finished tied for the 13th-best RB in football. Elliott is going to come in and get a ton of work right away -- he's a legit top-10 running back, and a consideration in the second half of the first round. Also worth noting that Romo's best fantasy season was 2012; Marion Barber had 1,257 total yards and 12 touchdowns that year.\n When I say Eli likes to throw in three-wide sets, I mean he LIKES TO THROW in three-wide sets. He did it 551 times last season, to be exact -- and that does not include four-receiver sets or any other formation. Exactly three WR's on the field ... 551 times or, to put another way, 89.2 percent of the time. Eli scored 244 fantasy points in three-WR sets, tops in the NFL in 2015 and the third most in a single season over the last five years (behind guys named Peyton Manning and \n). Now obviously, you throw the most from three-WR sets, you probably stand to score the most from three-WR sets. The point here is Ben McAdoo's system is fantasy friendly, they are going to throw a ton, and even if \n is back and healthy, Shepard will be on the field a lot as a No. 3 -- and given Cruz's history, Shepard could easily be a No. 2. Shepard, a 5-foot-10 speedster who is a terrific route-runner and has good hands, drew comparisons from McAdoo to a guy you might have heard of, \n. They are going to throw a lot in New York and now they have another guy to catch it, which is good for Eli, and it's a great landing spot for Shepard.\n After trying to re-sign \n, then trying to sign \n, kicking the tires on Arian Foster and being rumored to be in on a number of other free agent running backs, it really looked as if Miami was saying, \"We don't know who our starting running back will be this year, we just know we don't want it to be Jay Ajayi.\" And then they went out and drafted \n. Drake, a 6-1, 210-pound speedster, is not a guy who will be an every-down player -- Mel Kiper Jr. and Todd McShay were commenting during ESPN's draft coverage about how he's a specialist and not an every-down back -- which is how I see him, too. He'll be the third-down guy, some depth for Ajayi, but ultimately, Ajayi will be the main guy on first and second down and, if he can stay healthy, he'll flirt with top 20 RB numbers.\n Sometimes you don't have to be the best-looking dude at the bar, you only have to be the only dude at the bar. With no word on \n and not a lot of other talent in the receiving game save for tight end \n and running back \n., Coleman immediately slots into the No. 1 wide receiver role. A 5-11, 194-pound stud with speed to burn, he'll be a key cog in Hue Jackson's new offense. It depends on who is QB in Cleveland, of course, but while he has his faults, \n also has a cannon for an arm, and is fairly accurate deep. They will take a few (more?) shots a game to Coleman, and last year, the Browns ranked fifth in average time given to their QB before the pass is thrown. More time equals better chance for deep plays to develop, don'tcha know? As our friend Jeff Dooley of ProFootballFocus noted, Coleman's 3.97 yards per route run in 2015 was second-best in the class, and equal to \n's numbers in 2014. He'll be the focal point of a passing offense that won't be great but won't be terrible, either.\nGoing to a team that has \n as its QB is good for the fantasy value of any wideout, especially if you're 6-3, 212 pounds and going to a team with 5-10 \n and 5-11 \n. With no more Marques Colston, Thomas will team with \n to give the Saints some size in the red zone (I'm not expecting much out of \n). No QB attempted more red zone passes AND had a higher completion percentage on those throws than Brees in 2015. And I say a lot of those throws will go toward Thomas (whose hands are 5/8 of an inch bigger than Kawhi Leonard's ... he's got some big mitts!). Thomas scored or had a 30-plus-yard reception in 10 of his final 11 games in college, and he could eventually compete with Snead for second-most looks from Brees. At worst, he's the No. 3 on a team with a QB that leads the NFL in pass attempts over the last five years.\n No \n, no \n. ... They can't all go to \n and \n. As a long-standing member of the Not-a-Brandon-LaFell-believer club, Boyd lands in a potentially nice fantasy spot, with a good offense, good QB and the chance to be on the field quite a bit. Boyd scored or had 10-plus catches in seven of 12 games last year. He's 6-1, 197 pounds, and he's a good route-runner who has a versatile skill set. As our \n, at Pitt, Boyd \"ran the ball off jet sweeps, lined up in the backfield at times, played in the slot, threw on a rare occasion and made plays as an outside receiver.\" With Sanu gone, expect a few \"gadget\" plays for Boyd each week in an offense that ran the second-most red zone plays in 2015. He's a WR4 with some upside.\nI like that the \n are addressing the offensive lines issues, with two picks in the first three rounds going to strengthen the line. That can only help \n and \n. ... Not that \n's value could get much higher, but \n is a very good blocker at WR and another playmaker to stretch the field, which can only help loosen up defenses playing the Vikes. The less eight-man fronts Peterson sees, the better. ... \n landed in the perfect spot for his skill set. An excellent pass catcher, Dixon is a great fit for Marc Trestman's offense and has only 31-year-old \n (off an injury) ahead of him. He's already better than \n, \n or, ahem, \n. ... The fantasy graveyard is littered with those who have believed in NYG running backs, but you could argue Paul Perkins is the best running back on the Giants right now. Rookie-hating Tom Coughlin is gone and only 31-year-old, injury-prone \n and passing-down specialist \n stand between Perkins and a significant role on a fantasy-friendly offense. This is a nice spot for Perkins. ... \n is a name that deep-league dynasty guys should be aware of. We have seen lesser talents put up huge fantasy numbers under Chip Kelly and with only Colin \"They hate each other\" Kaepernick and \n ahead of him, Driskel could easily find playing time and fantasy relevance. ... The same goes for \n, who was already going to be one of the first wide receivers off the board in fantasy drafts this August. After drafting \n and \n to add to the Texans passing game, Nuk tweeted this:\nAin't no more double teams baby!\n- Deandre Hopkins (@Nukdabomb) \nWe agree, Mr. Hopkins. We agree.\n Went from potentially an interesting time share to fighting for the right to give Zeke Elliott a breather. They're in handcuff mode now, with no actual fantasy value except as potential insurance to the Elliott owner in your league.\nOh, they'll both still have value. The Titans are going to run, run, run and then run some more this season, and a mobile QB and an improving offensive line will only help that. Murray was looking like he could flirt with RB1 numbers this year as the only dog in a run-first offense, but now here comes Henry, who will take enough work away (especially short-yardage stuff) that will do just enough to knock Murray from low end RB1 to low end RB2/high end flex. Murray won't lose third-down work to Henry (though it remains to be seen how much \n gets used there) but ... it ain't great, ya know? Meanwhile, Henry, who could have been a very interesting flex or RB2 this year in the right situation, now becomes a handcuff /TD vulture type. Bleah.\nVery talented player who, on the right team, could have had an immediate fantasy impact. With \n as his quarterback on an offense that attempted the fewest passes in the NFL last year and had the second fewest passing touchdowns ... this has to be a disappointment. The offense will continue to revolve around Adrian Peterson, and I expect \n to take a nice leap this year -- leaving Treadwell to be a much better dynasty pick than anything significant for standard leagues this year.\nQuick, name the last good fantasy QB under Jeff Fisher. I'll wait. That didn't derive a lot of value from his legs, you McNair truthers. Exactly. I asked this question on Twitter and some folks threw Kerry Collins at me, but come on. Kerry Collins? I don't like any of the QBs drafted this year for fantasy, but if I had to pick one, give me \n, who has to beat out only \n and has two stud WRs to throw to, plus some running ability, a good QB-friendly coach in Gary Kubiak and a defense that will often put them in favorable field position. Unless you play in a league where you get points for handoffs, I want no part of him this year, even in a two-QB league.\nI absolutely love the player, and as a Skins fan, thought it was a good move -- especially with the impending free agency of \n and \n. He's a nice fit for Washington, and has the \"go up and win jump balls\" kind of skills that will ultimately play nicely with \n. He also has some nice size (6-2, 202 pounds), so he'll be who Cousins is looking for (along with \n, of course) when they get in close. While he's a terrific player to grab in dynasty, he has little value this year as long as Jackson, Garcon, Reed and \n are around.\nAnother guy who is interesting for dynasty leagues, but the struggles of rookie tight ends are well documented, and as long as \n is around -- how long do you think he has? Maybe only 10 more years? He's indestructible -- Henry is nothing more than depth for a team that already runs a lot of three-WR sets with only one TE.

I'm\n\nstill trying to figure this out.\"\nThe move, given Johnson's productivity and popularity during his tenure with the team, is somewhat dubious. The former Syracuse star has never been a favorite of the Butch Davis coaching staff, however, and was a frequent subject of trade rumors.\nBrowns fans are left wondering why Davis would release\n\nJohnson -- the team's most consistent receiver -- at this point in\n\nthe season and after signing him to a four-year, $13.35 million\n\ncontract extension with a $3.5 million signing bonus before last\n\nseason.\n\"This is not a knee-jerk reaction,\" Davis said in a statement.\n\n\"We have been trying for almost three seasons to help Kevin\n\nperform to the level of expectations we have had for him. I am\n\ndisappointed our staff has not been able to get him to accept the\n\nexpectations we have of how the wide receiver position should be\n\nplayed.\"\nJohnson said Davis called him into his office on Tuesday to\n\ninform him that he was no longer in the team's future plans.\n\"I'm really disappointed in the way it ended, simply because of\n\nall that I've done for him (Davis),\" Johnson told the AP. \"I never\n\nquestioned him and I never talked bad about him to anyone or about\n\nanything. It doesn't make sense.\"\nJohnson was demoted last week because coaches felt he had not blocked well in the running game and Johnson reacted by publicly noting he has been the Browns' leading receiver in every season with the team. That likely did not play well with team officials.\nJohnson, however, said he never questioned his benching. In fact, he was\n\nthe one who told Andre' Davis that he would be starting, the Associated Press reported.\n\"I took it like a man,\" said Johnson, whose 315 receptions\n\ntied him for fourth on the club's career list. \"I supported every\n\nguy who went in there.\n\"It was very disappointing not to be in there,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"We went 3-for-11 on third downs -- that's where I make my living.\n\nAll I've done is make plays for this team.\"\nThen again, the demotion did not play well in the locker room, where veterans have questioned some of Davis's past moves, and the Tuesday release of Johnson probably will send shock waves through the roster.\nJohnson was stunned to hear Davis' reasons behind releasing him.\n\"I guess I wasn't good enough,\" he told the AP. \"This is crazy.\"\nJohnson's relationship with Davis had been strained for some\n\ntime. As early as 2001, Davis' first season in Cleveland, he tried\n\nto trade Johnson.\nJohnson, 27, is subject to league waivers.\nIf he is claimed by another team, he must report, since the trade deadline has passed. But because he is a \"vested\" veteran, he has the right to declare himself an unrestricted free agent after the 2003 season. If he is unclaimed by Wednesday, which is anticipated, then Johnson becomes free to sign with any team.\nWithin hours of being released by the Browns, Johnson sat in his\n\nliving room and fielded several calls from NFL head coaches\n\ninterested in signing him.\nJohnson's cell phone was also ringing nonstop from Cleveland\n\nplayers offering their support and wishing their popular\n\nex-teammate well, the Associated Press reported.\nHis base salary for 2003 is $950,000, which means any team assuming his current deal will owe him a prorated portion based on remaining games, or about $391,000. Johnson was under contract through 2006, with scheduled base salaries of $1.45 million (2004), $1.4 million (2005) and $2.65 million (2006). There were annual workout bonuses of $100,000.\nBut he is also due a $2 million options bonus in 2005 and that almost certainly will preclude any club from claiming him on waivers.\nNever noted for his speed, Johnson nonetheless led the Browns in receptions in each of his first four seasons in Cleveland, and topped the team in catches again this year. Many scouts feel he has the best hands of any wide receiver in the NFL and that, while he lacks the playmaker skills of a \"lead\" wideout, is a prototype No. 2 wide receiver.\n\"Kevin had a diminished role in our offense, and he was not\n\nhappy with it,\" Davis said. \"We have a number of young, talented\n\nreceivers in Quincy Morgan, Andre Davis, Dennis Northcutt, Andre\n\nKing, Frisman Jackson and C.J. Jones. As a result, we did not\n\nforesee Kevin's role expanding in the future.\n\"This will enable him to get a fresh start, and it will allow\n\nour young receivers to continue to develop and improve. We wish\n\nKevin all the best.\"\nA second-round pick in the 1999 draft, and one of the few players remaining from the franchise's first year of its second incarnation, Johnson played in 73 games and started in all but one of them. He had 315 catches for 3,836 yards and 23 touchdowns. His average per catch this year, of just 9.5 yards, is well below his career standard of 12.6 yards, but there figures to be a strong market for Johnson among teams seeking to add a productive receiver for the stretch run.\nA message left by the Associated Press seeking comment from Johnson's agent, Tom Condon, was\n\nnot immediately returned.\nThe Browns said president Carmen Policy will address Johnson's\n\nrelease in a Wednesday morning news conference.\n\"I wanted to end my career here,\" Johnson told AP. \"That's what\n\nhurts me the most.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1659541"},

His Story in His Own Words,\" an as-told-to book written with longtime friend Mark McCormick of The Wichita Eagle.\nAs the clock ran out in Baltimore, he said, \"It also ran out in my career. I decided they could go on without me.\"\nIt would be months before Sanders shared that decision with the rest of the country in a brief retirement statement that only hinted at his true feelings. His retirement shocked the sports world because he was only 31 and on the verge of breaking Walter Payton's all-time NFL rushing record.\nAlthough the statement referred to his loss of will to continue in the NFL, it did not openly criticize the Lions' front office.\nSanders changes course in the book, saying a \"communications gap\" opened between him and the Lions' front office as the team unloaded quality players.\nAfter working to help Detroit try to build a winner throughout the 1990s, Sanders suffered as the Lions slumped to 5-11 in two of his last three seasons.\n\"After all these years, I'd come full circle,\" Sanders says in the book. \"It was tough to stay focused and motivated.\"\nThe realization that management no longer cared about winning \"slammed me harder than any linebacker had ever hit me in my entire career,\" Sanders says. \"That realization trivialized everything I did during the off-season to prepare myself. It trivialized everything I dreamed about from the time I was a kid in\n\nWichita ...\"\nIn another chapter, Sanders details the year when he became the third player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. That accomplishment was significant to Sanders, as were others such as reaching the 100-yard rushing mark in 14 consecutive games.\nThe record he walked away from wasn't as important, he says. Fed up with football, Sanders lost interest in chasing Payton's career rushing record.\n\"I had already achieved a level of success that gave me much satisfaction and pride. I didn't need to pass Walter to prove that to myself,\" says Sanders, who remains the third-leading NFL rusher of all time with 15,269 yards.\nAs for his brief retirement statement, Sanders says he didn't refer to his feelings about Lions management because he \"didn't want to take shots at people as I left.\"\nHis only regret, Sanders says, is that he didn't include a statement wishing his team good luck.\nThe 17-chapter book also details Sanders life from his childhood in Wichita to his years as a star at Oklahoma State University and into retirement.\nHe credits his mother, Shirley Sanders, for much of his success and discusses his often strained relationship with his father.\nSanders, who was with the Lions for 10 years, maintains a home in suburban Detroit.

For now, surgery is not recommended, but doctors will continue to monitor Winborn's condition.\nThe team placed Winborn on injured reserve on Friday and signed free agent linebacker Cornelius Anthony, who had been with the 49ers in training camp. Winborn spent all but three games of the 2002 season on injured reserve because of a knee injury.\n\"This [injury] is probably more serious, from the long-term standpoint, but every time you get hurt it's frustrating,\" said Winborn, a second-round pick in the 2001 draft who has been limited to just 26 appearances because of his injuries. \"You feel like you're just letting everybody down: the team, your family, yourself. But I'm determined [to come back].\"\nAlthough not officially listed as a starter, Winborn plays nearly as many snaps as the San Francisco first-unit linebackers, and his loss will force the 49ers to scramble. Second-year veteran \n will replace Winborn but the former Alabama standout, who has played primarily on special teams this season, has big shoes to fill.\nWinborn, 24, typically plays in some \"base\" situations at the \"plugger\" position, but he is more involved in \"nickel\" packages, where he is superb in coverage and a surprisingly effective blitzer as well. The presence of Winborn on the field on third down contributes to the excellence of strongside linebacker \n, regarded as one of the league's premier defenders in 2003.\nIn nine games, Winborn has 37 tackles and three sacks.\n\"He's has the same value to us as a starter,\" coach Dennis Erickson said of Winborn. \"He is a huge part of what we do.\"\nAn articulate player who is well-grounded, Winborn is aware of the seriousness nature of his back injury and will be \"very involved,\" he said, in the evaluation process.\nThe former Vanderbilt star might be fortunate that 49ers trainers recommended the MRI exam after Winborn complained of soreness in his back. Winborn was prepared just to be treated by a chiropractor and planned to play in Monday's game against Pittsburgh.

{"title": "A coach's greatest challenge", "text": "\nSo now Bill Callahan, like every coach to ever come before him in this situation, has to ask the basic questions, some of them of himself. He has to ask whether he's coaching for this job or the next one (Jim Fassel, come on down). He has to ask whether there is truly virtue in sticking with what doesn't work simply because it's yours (Dave Wannstedt, you have the floor).\nAnd Callahan can ask some other questions. He can ask whether, as many suspect, the Oakland Raiders were headed into this morass with or without him -- whether the Raiders' front office pushed a successful golden-oldies formula to just beyond its stretch point, to the place where seasoned veterans turn into injury-list regulars and continuity becomes a holy grail rather than an everyday given.\nHe can ask where those veterans were, the ones who reached the Super Bowl in January with him as their coach but fell silent when the first carping shots began whistling across Callahan's bow.\nHe could certainly spend the rest of the month wondering what suddenly seized up inside Al Davis, to the point that the Raiders' owner could speak not a word of public support for the embattled coach whom Davis personally selected to succeed Jon Gruden.\nHe could do all of it, Callahan. But why quibble? It's academic here. Practically pure aftermath.\nThe big loss, that is, already has been posted.\nOne of the NFL's most interesting subspecies, if sometimes the most painful to study, is the coach perceived as having lost his team.  It may or may not be true for Wannstedt and Fassel, two veterans fighting to set their franchises back on playoff tracks -- or for Dan Reeves, the man in Deion Sanders' myopic sights. In Callahan's case, one need not wonder.\nIn the immediate wake of Charles Woodson's lambasting of Callahan, that the Raider players had lost confidence in their coach amid the frustration of a 2-7 season, the most resounding sense was the silence. Woodson essentially wrote off Callahan as a man whose ego wouldn't allow him to make use of his players' experience and expertise, first in an interview with ESPN's Andrea Kremer, later to just about anyone with a notepad or a microphone.\nWoodson made it personal. He made it about both style and substance. And he was never rebutted, not even by Callahan himself, whose detached, delayed, seemingly impervious response to being scalded by a minion spoke volumes about the distance established between the coach and the locker room.\nTo be fair, several days down the road, a few of the offensive linemen loyal to Callahan from his days as their coordinator said they'd stand behind him. By then, the Raiders' Alameda training facility was all but engulfed in flames.\nThe club, already heavily hit by injuries to game-changers like deep-threat receiver Jerry Porter, lost quarterback Rich Gannon, the heart of the offense no matter how erratically he performed in the early season. Center Barret Robbins, so crucial to Oakland's success in 2002, made an injury-delayed return to the lineup, only to see stalwarts like Lincoln Kennedy limp off the field. Callahan attempted to chart a course away from some of what Gruden ran, often with disastrous, offense-deadening results.\nThe season got over quickly. It just keeps getting more and more over.\nAll of which brings Callahan to a weird and unenviable position -- although, in the world of coaching, hardly a unique one. He is down, essentially, to relying on the honor of many of the established front-liners with whom (to hear Woodson tell it) Callahan long ago lost meaningful contact. But their honor is all he has.\nAt 2-7, of course, the value of all that can stand in debate. The Raiders might finish with the worst record of any defending Super Bowl entrant in the history of the NFL. Gannon, not even 10 months removed from a Most Valuable Player sortie through 16 games plus a full postseason, is dealing with the question of whether he'll ever regain his form.\nTim Brown is unbowed, but unquestionably bloodied. Jerry Rice, ahead of the curve weeks before Woodson took the case public, said ominously early in the season, \"I didn't come back for this.\"\nAs for Callahan: It is beyond the bounds of reason, not to mention the arc of Davis' career as owner, to suggest that the coach can survive this kind of team collapse. In that regard, some view Davis' silence as the ultimate rebuke, even given Al's general disinclination to go public with his thoughts.\nIt's a ghost ship Callahan steers -- some good coaches with their own futures up in the air, players like Woodson already with two feet at the edge of the door, fans thinning with each home non-sellout. All around the Raiders lies the general feeling of disbelief, the natural shock that a team good enough to win the AFC last season could disintegrate to the point that its chance to defend the title is over by the midseason turn.\nCallahan has nothing to appeal to now but the players' pride, and stop me if this sounds at all familiar. It is the exit strategy of just about every self-respecting head coach in football history, Lombardi to Allen to Parcells, Ditka and beyond. Maybe, in the end, the Raiders just won't play for Bill Callahan anymore. He is down to hoping they're still willing to play for themselves.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=kreidler_mark&id=1659529"},

{"title": "Browns suffer another setback", "text": "\nBEREA, Ohio -- An already trying stretch for the \n has become even more tumultuous.\nStarting tailback \n has been suspended four games following a repeat violation of the NFL substance abuse policy, the league announced Thursday.\nGreen was already enrolled in the league's treatment program,\n\nand the suspension means the second-year back had twice violated\n\nhis personal program.\nEarlier on Thursday Green withdrew his appeal, which hastened implementation of the penalty.\n\"We commend him for accepting the responsibilities and\n\nconsequences of his conduct and immediately moving forward in a\n\npositive fashion, with the emphasis on resolution rather than\n\navoidance,\" said Browns president Carmen Policy.\nEarlier this week cut wide receiver Kevin Johnson, the franchise's leading receiver in each of his five seasons with the club.\n\"It has been a very difficult week,\" Policy said.\nGreen's suspension is just the latest setback for the Browns, who have lost their last three games. The team has been unable to settle on a starting quarterback, and has faced injuries that have forced coaches to use nine different offensive line starters.\nGreen, 23, served a one-game team suspension for last week's matchup with Kansas City following an Oct. 27 arrest for driving recklessly in a Cleveland suburb. The arrest also included charges for DUI and for marijuana possession. The suspension by the Browns came despite recommendations to club officials from the league that the sanctions might violate some stipulations of the collective bargaining agreement.\nThe league will count that game as part of its suspension.\nSuspensions for violations of the substance abuse policy fall under the purview of the NFL, and not individual franchises, and the NFL Players Association is poised to file a grievance against the club. Green was docked $17,647 for the team-levied suspension, the equivalent of one game-check, based on his 2003 base salary of $300,000.\nPolicy insisted on Wednesday morning that the action by the club was \"for reasons that were in addition to, albeit surrounding, the arrest for DUI and the possession charge.\"\nCleveland officials and coaches were cryptic on Wednesday when asked if Green would return to the field this weekend. There are suspicions that the Browns were alerted by the NFL that a league-mandated suspension was pending. It may have been little more than coincidence, but it is nonetheless notable, that the Browns on Wednesday activated rookie tailback \n from the physically unable to perform list and conceded he could see his first action of the season this weekend.\nJames Jackson will start in Green's spot on Sunday against\n\nArizona.\nGreen will lose $70,588, and he is not eligible to\n\nplay until Dec. 8 when the Browns host the Rams.\nGreen, a former Boston College star, tested positive for marijuana at least once during his college career and was suspended for the offense.\nHis off-field problems at Boston College, combined with an ulcerative colitis condition that has been successfully controlled with medication, dropped Green's stock a bit in the '02 draft. He was widely regarded as the premier tailback prospect but fell to the 16th overall slot. He signed a seven-year contract that voided to five years at a total of $7.85 million, and the deal included a $4.1 million signing bonus.\nAfter a slow start, Green emerged over the second half of the season as a real force and he finished his rookie campaign with 243 carries for 887 yards and six touchdowns. In six games this season, Green has 559 yards and one touchdown on 142 attempts. In addition to the game he missed for suspension last Sunday, he also was sidelined for an Oct. 26 contest at New England because of a shoulder separation.\nPolicy said despite Green's problems, the Browns consider him a\n\nbig part of their future.\n\"We're going to do our darndest day and night to help him do\n\nwhatever he has to do to keep his life in order,\" Policy said.\nPolicy said Green, who hasn't spoken to the media since his\n\narrest, is sorry for his actions.\n\"He breaks your heart, because he's contrite,\" Policy said.\n\n\"His reaction to accepting the suspension immediately goes a long\n\nway in my mind to saying we've taken a pretty big step in the right\n\ndirection.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1660947"},

{"title": "Ravens get shot at Owens", "text": "\n\n\nNo one inspires passion in an opponent like \n.\nIn fact, the only upset heading into Sunday's anticipated game between the \n and \n was that it was Ravens linebacker No. 56 -- not No. 52 \n -- who was calling out the Eagles wide receiver on ESPN Radio. Hartwell observed that when Owens played against the Ravens for the 49ers last season he caught just three passes for 23 yards. It was the first volley in a week of posturing that stems from those queasy dozen days in March when Owens seemed destined to play for the Ravens.\nIt began in early February in Honolulu when Lewis and Philadelphia quarterback \n -- two of the finest players in the game -- actively recruited Owens to play for their respective teams. Owens was initially traded to the Ravens, but refused to appear for the physical that would have completed the deal. After the NFL Players Association filed a grievance, the trade was voided and a three-way settlement between the 49ers, Eagles and Ravens was reached before an arbiter heard the case.\nWonder of wonders, the glowering Lewis took it personally when the Ravens wound up with a fifth-round draft choice and the Eagles got Owens. Lewis said Owens went \"against his word\" and ominously advised him not to come across the middle when he was playing the Ravens.\nOwens countered that Lewis was \"not the hardest hitter that ever played the game of football\" and said he wouldn't shy away from a confrontation.\nLewis' response: \"Tell T.O. to keep my name out of his mouth. I don't care nothing about this guy. Why does he need me to make his reputation? Tell him I'm tired of that. I play football. And, sooner or later, no matter how much he talks about what he's not scared to do, he still has to line up and play football.\"\nWhich is precisely what Owens has done. Despite three consecutive appearances in the NFC championship game, there was something missing from the Eagles -- specifically, a deep threat. Well, last week against the Browns, Owens caught four passes for 109 yards and two touchdowns in a 34-31 overtime victory. He became the first Eagles player to have four consecutive 100-yard games since Mike Quick in 1983. Owens has 34 catches, 596 yards and eight touchdowns -- tied with \n for league lead.\nThe most important numbers in Philadelphia, though, are 6-0 -- the Eagles' best start since 1981. Owens has been an enormous factor; you can see his presence in the effectiveness of wideout \n. With Owens often drawing double coverage, Pinkston caught six passes for 100 yards, making Owens and Pinkston the first pair of Eagles receivers to hit 100 yards since Fred Barnett and Calvin Williams in 1992.\nBrad Childress, the Eagles offensive coordinator, is the grateful recipient of Owens' talent. When Childress answered the phone past midnight early Wednesday morning, his enthusiasm was impressive indeed.\n\"You know, I really couldn't be any happier,\" he said from his office in the team's facility. \"And not just because of his production. This is a guy eight, nine years in the West Coast offense. He doesn't give you 'that's how we did it here.' He wants to be coached. He wants to please you, and you appreciate that.\"\nWill Childress draw up a few routes that take Owens across the middle?\n\"You're attacking a scheme,\" Childress said, laughing. \"If there's a guy who is a liability, you attack that guy. They play a 3-4 defense, which is a little novel these days. But we've seen it a lot in the preseason. We'll just have to see how the game goes.\"\nBut before the game comes the headlines ¬Ö and contention.\nThe biggest controversy so far is being stirred up by some comments in Owens' recent autobiography concerning Ozzie Newsome. Owens wrote that Newsome told the\n\nwide receiver's agent that, \"He was a black man from Alabama just\n\nlike T.O.\" and that \"sometimes a black man's gotta be slapped.\"\n\"Initially, I was kind of stunned by it,\" Owens said. \"My agent was kind of reluctant to tell me about it at the time. What a lot of people don't know, and I guess I'll let it out now, is that was pretty much one of the main reasons I didn't want to go there.''\nNewsome has said that he doesn't want to talk about the situation\n\"Please, why should I respond to that? I did tell T.O. that he\n\nshould check with the veterans we brought in over the years,\" he\n\ntold The Baltimore Sun. \"I told him to call\n\nRod Woodson, Shannon Sharpe, Michael McCrary and Sam Adams, and\n\nthey will let him know how we treat veterans here.\"\nOwens garners so much attention that even a busy politician inquired about the receiver. When the President of the United States met Philadelphia tight end \n earlier this month, he had one question. No, it didn't involve the war in Iraq, the expanding deficit or the upcoming election.\n\"He wanted to know about T.O.,\" Lewis said after meeting George Bush at a campaign stop in Marlton, N.J. \"He asked if T.O. was really as controversial as he'd heard. I told him most of it was exaggerated and hyped, and that I figured he could probably relate to that.\n\"He said he could.\"\nPerhaps the most insightful comments from Owens regarding Lewis came before the season even started.\n\"I know everyone will say it's going to be me against Ray,\" Owens told Playboy reporter Dewey Hammond in the Sept. 1 issue. \"But Ray doesn't play defensive back; he plays linebacker. Some of my routes take me across the middle or whatever, but guess what -- I'm not the whole Eagles team, and he's not the whole Ravens team.\n\"We both hold great positions. He's a big piece of the puzzle there. I'm obviously going to be a big piece of the puzzle in Philly. Whatever he needs to do to pump up our game and get us some good ratings when we play, by all means, he should do what he's got to do.\"\nIn the end, Owens did what \n had to do. He signed a seven-year, $42 million contract. Both Owens and McNabb had a lot to prove this season; Owens is trying to rinse away his reputation as a self-centered whiner and McNabb wants to prove he can throw it deep. So far, the early returns are positive.\nMcNabb completed  28 of 43 passes against Cleveland for 376 yards and four touchdowns. Ten different Eagles receivers caught passes -- a critical factor since last year's three-headed running back ceases to exist. \n is carrying the Steelers in Pittsburgh and \n was placed on injured reserve with a knee injury. The last one standing was \n and he may be out for two games after breaking a rib in the game against the Browns.\nNo one can argue that Owens would be better off in Baltimore.\nThe biggest reason is the quarterbacks involved -- a factor in his decision. McNabb is rated third among the league's quarterbacks (behind the Rams' \n and \n of the Colts) at 105.6. Baltimore's \n is ranked 30th with a passer rating of 61.8. In last week's 20-6 victory over Buffalo, the Ravens ran 17 plays in the second half and gained 21 yards -- none of them in the passing game. Making matters more difficult for the Ravens, they'll miss suspended running back \n for a second game.\nLewis has implied that Owens chose Philadelphia because he wouldn't fit in with Baltimore's family atmosphere.\n\"He knows that's not true,\" Owens told Playboy. \"Both teams are good. They were both choices of mine. Like I said time and again, I went with Philadelphia because one, I'm familiar with the West Coast offense. Two, the coaching staff has been with me for the past two or three years in the Pro Bowl, so they're familiar with me and I'm familiar with them. And three, they have Donovan McNabb at quarterback.\n\"Lewis can say whatever he wants to say to make a story. That's all it is. I don't really care about having the spotlight, because what I do on the field is spotlight in itself. I'm not trying to position myself for a spotlight with Ray Lewis. If that's what he wants to think, then by all means, go on CNN, go on 60 Minutes.\"\nThis confrontation has already happened, in a \"Groundhog Day\" kind of way. The Eagles, you may remember, beat the Ravens 26-17 back on Aug. 20 in the second preseason game. Owens scored on an 81-yard reception on Philadelphia's first play from scrimmage.\nAfterward, he said, \"As far as Ray, we're good friends. We talk between plays. I told him I loved him and he told me he loved me back. It's all blown out of proportion by what the media is trying to say.\"\nRight.\nBaltimore has a history of being jilted in its relationship with the NFL. In 1983, John Elway said he would refuse to play in the city and wound up leading Denver to two Super Bowl victories and being enshrined at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 1984, the Colts essentially told Baltimore that they refused to play in the place they call Charm City. Two decades later, when Owens spurned the Ravens, it gave Baltimore a dubious trifecta of rejection.\nEverywhere he goes, Owens draws attention in almost pathological fashion. There was the spiked star episode in Dallas, of course, and post-touchdown celebrations involving a Sharpie and a cheerleader's pom-poms. Last Sunday, there was an entertaining moment following his 39-yard touchdown when Owens threw the ball at the clever and sophisticated (yet oddly humorous) sign with the slogan \"T.O has B.O.\"\n\n    The next big stage for Owens? In two weeks, the Eagles travel to Dallas for a prime-time game on Monday Night Football, where the star awaits at Texas Stadium. Whatever happens, the media will doubtless blow it out of proportion.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=1910793"},

Williams had surgery Wednesday and is expected to take six months to recover.\n\"It was unnecessary,\" Bengals defensive tackle \n said.\n\n\"He said he didn't mean to do it, but they're coached to do it. I blame Mike Shanahan.\"\nTechnically, the cut block -- a block below an opponent's waist --\n\nwas legal because Foster's helmet was in front of Williams at\n\ncontact. But it was vicious, too, in part because Williams didn't\n\nsee it coming. It also looked unnecessary given that the play was\n\nmoving away from the spot where the block was made.\n\"Although people may say it's not illegal, it doesn't\n\nnecessarily have to be a part of the game,\" Bengals coach Marvin\n\nLewis said. \"There was no reason to block a man low like that when\n\nhe has his back basically turned to you.

I've got to do my job.'\n\nThey just need to do some other methods of teaching how to block.\"\nThe Bengals' angry reaction was to be expected. Critical\n\ncomments from Steelers coach Bill Cowher certainly weren't.\n\"A lot of it comes down to, in my mind, respect for the game\n\nand respect for the players,\" Cowher said Tuesday. \"Do unto\n\nothers as you want others to do unto you. It's a physical game that\n\nwe play. It's a very competitive game that we play, but within that\n\nthere are certain lines that you don't go over.\"\nIt came as little surprise, then, that Shanahan's video package\n\nincluded a number of plays in which Steelers offensive linemen are\n\nseen making cut blocks. He also showed the Bengals doing it in\n\nMonday night's game.\n\"I was a little offended with Bill Cowher's statement because\n\nthey do it,\" Shanahan said. \"So, those type things do occur, and\n\nyou just have to deal with it.\"\nIn fact, the Broncos will be dealing with it on Sunday when they\n\nplay the \n.

The two had to be separated by players and coaches as they neared the tunnel to the locker rooms.\n\"I am never one to back down from anyone, no matter who it is,\" Sapp explained later. \"He is a punk who had one good game.\"\nActually, it's two.\nThe Broncos are 5-1 after their 31-3 dismantling of the Raiders and the emergence of Droughns, a backup fullback-turned-starting tailback, is one of the league's more compelling story lines. America will get its first extended look at Droughns on Monday night (9 p.m. ET, ABC), when the Broncos meet the \n at Paul Brown Stadium.\nAfter carrying 30 times for 193 yards against the \n in Week 5, Droughns burned Sapp and the Raiders for 176 yards on 38 carries -- two of the NFL's five highest rushing totals so far this season and a two-game total of 369 yards on 68 carries for the 26-year-old. By contrast, the team that gave up on him, the \n, have run the ball 119 times for 382 yards in five games.\n\"You don't want people to doubt you and you don't want the team to doubt you,\" Droughns, who had 97 yards on 40 carries in four previous seasons, told reporters after the Raiders' game. \"You have to let them know, 'I'm going to be there for you and fight as hard as I can for you.' \"\nThis is a ridiculous rags-to-riches story -- admittedly, early in the curve -- that approaches the former Iowa grocery shelf-stocker who won the Super Bowl XXXIV MVP Award, or the sixth-round draft choice who replaced the franchise player and won the MVP in Super Bowls XXXVI and XXXVIII. But after two scintillating games, Droughns isn't drawing the kind of attention that made \n and \n household names.\nThat's because this is the Broncos, and it's happened before.\nAfter \n (sixth-round choice in 1995) wore down, head coach Mike Shanahan dropped \n (fourth-round choice in 1999) behind a disciplined and effective offensive line. In 1999, Gary produced a 1,000-yard season and then a total of 555 yards over the next three. \n (sixth-round choice in 2000) got the call a year later and produced 1,487 yards. \n (second-round choice in 2002) cleared 1,500 yards in 2002 and 2003 before the Broncos were moved to trade him to the \n for cornerback \n.\nIt's the system, stupid.\nThe interesting thing? In the 10 seasons since Mike Shanahan arrived in 1995, none of those other backs -- even Davis or Portis -- equaled Droughns' numbers in their first two starts.\nDroughns, who played at Merced (Ca.) Junior College for two years before rushing rushed for 2,058 yards in two seasons at Oregon, was a third-round draft choice of the Lions in 2000. But he suffered a separated right shoulder on his first carry of the NFL preseason and was placed on injured reserve for the entire season. In 2001, he was waived by Detroit and spent time as a practice player with the Dolphins before re-signing with the Lions in October. He played in nine games, but Detroit did not renew his contract and the Broncos signed him as a free agent in 2002.\nFor two years, he was largely a special teams contributor, making tackles in kick coverage and returning kickoffs. Coming into this season, Droughns had seven starts in four years. And when tailback \n gained 156 yards against the \n in the season opener, it looked like Droughns would again play a supporting role, this time as a fullback. But when Griffin suffered an ankle injury late in the game against Tampa Bay, Droughns was Shanahan's starter at tailback against the Panthers. In a bit of gamesmanship against the team that fired him (some would call it something worse), Shanahan listed Droughns as the starting fullback before the Raiders game, with Griffin at tailback. Droughns started the game at tailback and Griffin carried the ball only four times.\n\"Reuben Droughns is our starter,\" Shanahan said coyly after the game. \"I'm not sure if all of you noticed that early on.\"\nDroughns has now carried the ball 78 times for 399 yards, a 5.1-yard average per carry that is surpassed only by the Giants' \n and \n of Philadelphia among leading rushers. At 5-foot-11, 207 pounds, Droughns is not a classic tailback. He is a straight-ahead power runner who bounces off opposing would-be tacklers.\n\"I figure I'd rather lower my shoulder and hit them, not just let them take shots at me,\" Droughns said. \"I'm a little bruised up, but that's OK. I like carrying the ball that much. I feel like I get stronger as the game goes on.\"\nIn the last two games, the Broncos lined him up in a one-back set and then shifted tight ends \n and \n into the fullback slot to block. With Carswell serving a one-game suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy, that look may change this week against the Bengals.\nAccording to Terrell Davis, Droughns' success can be partly attributed to understanding the fullback position.\n\"He has the best advantage of anybody that's played back there,\" Davis told Denver's Rocky Mountain News earlier this week. \"When you're a fullback and you know the offense and understand the blocking and the reads he makes, it's exactly how the runner would run the ball. So he's had that bird's-eye view for a long time. And then he has the mental toughness as far as being a fullback, which translates into being a tough runner.\"\nSaid Shanahan, \"He loves carrying the ball. Anytime you carry the ball 38 times and you still look fresh on your 38th carry, you're enjoying what you're doing.\"\nAfter being in the wrong place at the wrong time for four NFL seasons, Droughns' timing, finally, is superb. Griffin's injury -- as well as preseason injuries to Mike Anderson and rookie Tatum Bell -- elevated him to the starting position against two teams who have difficulty stopping the run; Carolina was ranked No. 29 and Oakland was No. 27.\nAnd now there is this piece of good news: Monday night's opponent, the Cincinnati Bengals, are ranked last among the league's 32 teams in stopping the run. The guy Warren Sapp called a punk who had one good game has another tantalizing opportunity. Sometime after midnight on the East Coast, fans around the country may well know who he is.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=1906725"},

The Patriots quarterback was forced out of the pocket and took off toward the first-down marker. One yard short of first down, Seahawks defensive end \n got a hold on Brady. Then came Boulware, who blasted Brady so hard that the quarterback lost his helmet and the ball. Seattle defensive tackle \n recovered the fumble.\n\"I didn't know the whole hit was me,\" Boulware admitted. \"I thought it was someone else. It stunned me a little when I saw him lying there. I just kind of cleaned him up, and I just kind of fell into the play.\"\nOn New England's next possession, Boulware intercepted Brady. The Seahawks responded with a touchdown and two-point conversion to narrow the deficit to 20-17.\nIn addition to leading the Seahawks with three interceptions, Boulware also has four pass deflections.\n:\nThe first-rounder from Oklahoma is the Bears' fifth-leading tackler with 20. However, his presence up the middle hasn't made Chicago more effective against the run, so far. After being shredded for 171 yards by \n in a loss to Washington on Sunday, the Bears are ranked 29th against the run -- one spot lower than what they finished a year ago.\nThe Chargers were so impressed with Kaeding before the draft that they used a third-round pick on him. In contrast, many rookie kickers are either second-day draft picks or signed as non-drafted free agents. But through six games, the Iowa alumnus is proving his worth. Kaeding kicked a career-high 53-yard field goal in the loss to Atlanta on Sunday and has converted all nine of his field goals and 19 PATs. He's already hit two 50-plus yard field goals.\nThe fourth-rounder has looked so good in his first two starts that the question already has been raised -- what happens when and if the Vikings' three veteran running backs are all healthy? Moore followed up an impressive outing in Week 5 with 187 offensive yards in Sunday's victory against the Saints. \n saw some action against New Orleans, but \n has two more weeks of a suspension to serve and the return of \n is uncertain. \"Mewelde was a luxury,\" Vikings offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said. \"Now he's a necessity.\" The Vikings have announced that Moore, who has accumulated 201 rushing and 168 receiving yards in the past two weeks, will start against Tennessee on Sunday even if Bennett is ready to play.\nThe first-rounder's official nickname is Big Ben. But don't be surprised if folks also start calling him Mr. Efficient. In the past two weeks, the Miami (Ohio) alumnus has completed 37 of 46 passes and is just one of four quarterbacks in the league with a 100 passer rating. \"We're starting to expand our playbook more and more,\" Steelers wide receiver \n said after the team's win over Dallas. \"The more reps he gets in practice, the better it gets. The kid's good. I'm just glad to be a part of it.\"\nA week after filling in for injured kicker \n, the Texas Tech alumnus was able to focus on his top priority -- special teams. Welker returned four kicks for 80 yards and also had a punt return of five yards in the loss to Buffalo.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?page=rookie2004/week6"},

{"title": "Steelers passed on Marino in draft", "text": "\nPITTSBURGH -- Asked to name the last rookie quarterback who\n\nimpressed him as much as the Steelers' \n, \n coach Bill Parcells immediately dropped a name familiar to\n\nmost Pittsburghers.\nDan Marino.\n\"He is the best (quarterback) prospect I have seen in 10 or 15\n\nyears,\" Parcells said Wednesday during a conference call. \"I have\n\nnot seen anybody come in the league like that. The only guy that I\n\ncan say came in, and the first year started playing like he is\n\nplaying, is Dan Marino.\"\nThe Steelers, then on the downslide following their Super Bowl\n\nsuccesses of the 1970s, regretted for years not drafting Marino, a\n\nlocal college star, in 1983. Partly because of that decision, they\n\nnever did find a comparable replacement for Hall of Fame\n\nquarterback Terry Bradshaw, winning only two playoff games from\n\n1980 through 1993.\nParcells doesn't think the Steelers will ever regret taking\n\nRoethlisberger, who is 3-0 as a starter since replacing the injured\n\n\n. The Steelers (4-1) play at Dallas (2-2) on Sunday.\nRoethlisberger enjoyed one of the best all-around games in years\n\nby a Steelers quarterback Sunday, throwing for a touchdown, running\n\nfor another while constantly keeping Cleveland's defense\n\noff-balance with his scrambling in a 34-23 victory.\n\"He is out of the pocket throwing 50-yard passes right on the\n\nmoney,\" Parcells said. \"It is not going to be without growing\n\npains, but I think he is in an ideal situation. They have good\n\nbalance on offense. They are running the ball well. They have a\n\ngood receiving corps. ... I am telling you, I am very, very\n\nimpressed, and it is not just because he is an opponent.\"\nRoethlisberger respectfully accepted the praise but detected a\n\nveteran coach employing some pregame psychological trickery.\n\"He's been around for a long time. He knows what he's doing. He\n\nhas no problem putting those (comments) out there and trying to get\n\ninside someone's head,\" Roethlisberger said. \"So I've just got to\n\ngo and play my game and, hopefully, win the football game.\"\nAs for any comparison to Marino, Roethlisberger said that should\n\nwait for, oh, another 15 years or so. Marino threw for 61,361 yards\n\nduring his 17-season NFL career, or nearly 10,000 yards more than\n\nany other quarterback in league history.\n\"Obviously, it's quite a compliment coming from Coach\n\nParcells,\" Roethlisberger said. \"Being a guy who's been around a\n\nlong time, he knows talent. But if I've said it once I've said it a\n\nmillion times, it's only been three games. It's a little too early\n\nto be putting those statements on it.\n\"If I can be half as good as Marino, I'll be incredibly\n\nhappy.\"\nRoethlisberger is only the fourth non-replacement rookie\n\nquarterback since the NFL merger in 1970 to win his first three NFL\n\nstarts. He has enjoyed a far better debut than the last Steelers\n\nfirst-round quarterback to start as a rookie -- Bradshaw, who had\n\nonly six touchdown passes and 24 interceptions in 1970.\nNow, Roethlisberger will try to do what no Steelers quarterback\n\nsince Bradshaw has done by winning in Dallas. The Steelers are 0-2\n\nthere since the Bradshaw-led Steelers won their 1982 opener there\n\n36-28 on a Monday night, \n's first game as their\n\nkicker.\nRoethlisberger expects to see a lot more blitzing from the\n\nCowboys than he got from the Browns, who blitzed him only a\n\nhalf-dozen times and instead waited for him to make mistakes.\n\"You never know exactly what you're going to face, but we've\n\nseen some things where they probably will bring some all-out\n\nblitzes at us and try to use their secondary (to make plays),\"\n\nRoethlisberger said. \"It definitely will be a challenge.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1901431"},

{"title": "End could be near for Haslett", "text": "\nATLANTA -- Walking toward the Georgia Dome on Sunday afternoon, I ran into an old acquaintance from Western Pennsylvania who had also been transplanted here, and he inquired about the pending fate of \n coach Jim Haslett, like both of us a Pittsburgh-area native.\nI noted that things didn't look good for Haslett, whose team has underachieved for much of his five-year tenure in The Big Uneasy. The acquaintance shook his head and noted that Haslett seemed like a good man, the kind of guy you could sit and have an Iron City beer with. Good call, indeed, but also a stark reminder that most coaches facing the firing squad tend to be good men whose teams, for whatever reasons, go bad on them.\nAbout five hours later, the reminder became even more stark, as I passed Haslett on my way from the Falcons locker room to his team's dressing area. On his way to the bus that would ferry the Saints to the airport, he stopped to shake hands, and his face was pale and drawn. The man was, it seemed, emotionally spent, weary, seemingly out of answers. His team, rallying behind the verbal lambasting he delivered at halftime, had once again managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, losing for the seventh time, and likely bouncing the Saints from the playoff chase, even in the diluted NFC. \"Hey, hang in there, Jim,\" I said feebly, and he nodded weakly.\nA few minutes earlier, in perhaps the one lucid moment of his own press conference, Falcons coach Jim Mora had spoken eloquently about his friendship with Haslett, and how proud he was that the New Orleans coach had prepared his team so well for Sunday's contest. The two men worked together years ago on the staff of Jim Mora the Elder, had remained close friends and still spoke frequently by phone. Not only as a friend, but also a member of the coaching fraternity, Mora certainly grasps the situation Haslett is in and took the opportunity to offer an endorsement in his buddy's behalf. That was before Mora opted to chide the media assemblage for daring to suggest that the Falcons offense, which scored on two of its first three possessions and then managed only a field goal on the next eight, suffered a near-fatal mid-game lull.\nBut at least before he went off half-cocked, Mora did a nice thing for Haslett. It's easy to criticize Haslett, whose team has underachieved and whose roster seems to annually squander talent. Almost to a man, Saints players will tell you Haslett is a solid coach, a man for whom they enjoy working.\nAlas, their deeds do not reflect their words. Like most NFL coaches, Haslett works hard, sweats the details, puts his guts on the line on Sunday afternoons. Watching him exit the Georgia Dome on Sunday evening, almost in automaton fashion, you couldn't help but feel for the guy. Unfortunately, in a business where you are hired to eventually be fired, Haslett will soon be pink-slipped by owner Tom Benson. That, of course, doesn't make him any less a good guy.\nThe good and the ugly\n\nSpeaking of good guys, it's nice to see that \n rookie coach Mike Mularkey has his team on the upswing. The Bills blistered Seattle on Sunday, dominating the NFC West leaders by a 38-9 count on the road, and have now won five of seven contests.\nIt's too bad the surging Bills aren't in the NFC because, at 5-6, they would be in the playoff hunt. Buffalo got off to an 0-4 start, with \n again struggling in a new offense, and that all but scuttled the Bills' season.\nBledsoe managed to survive three interceptions Sunday but, in general, his play has been much better and he has gotten plenty of help from tailback \n, who authored his fifth 100-yard outing in six starts. Amazingly, McGahee needs to average just 54.8 yards now to record his first 1,000-yard season.\nCertainly he is a big part of the future in Buffalo but, even with the Bills' late-season uptick, that future remains cloudy and very difficult to predict because of the quarterback situation. Maybe the Mularkey offensive design, and the tutelage of coordinator Tom Clements and quarterbacks coach Sam Wyche will yet salvage Bledsoe's career. But the downside (for lack of a better term) of the Buffalo turnaround is that heir apparent \n may not get any starts in the stretch now, after it appeared the once-floundering Bills would get their first-round draft choice on the field at some point in the final month.\nOf course, even murkier than the Bills' future, particularly after Sunday, is that of the bipolar Seahawks.\n\nThere are three very prominent pending unrestricted free agents on the offensive side -- quarterback \n, tailback \n and left tackle \n -- and you have to wonder how much owner Paul Allen is willing to invest in any of them.\nHasselbeck, who seemed to turn the corner last season, seems to have regressed. He has four games this season in which he completed more than 60 percent of his passes and four outings in which his completion rate was less than 50 percent. After the Sunday mess, in which he completed only 19 of 38 throws, Hasselbeck now has four games in which he amassed more than 15 incomplete passes. There are games of 19, 21, 23 and 27 incompletions. Not good for a player best noted for his accuracy, even worse in a Seattle offense that is clearly quarterback-driven.\nThe collapse of the Seahawks, a team more severely flawed than anyone would have expected at the outset of the season, could have an effect as well on the future of coach Mike Holmgren. The smart money is that Holmgren is back in '05. But if the Seahawks fail to make the playoffs after a 3-0 start when they looked like one of the best teams in the league, well, you just never know.\nOh, yeah, the NFC West is now a collective 2-10 in games against the AFC East this season.\n\nOffensive explosion\n\nWow! I mean, what other \"observation\" could you have after watching even a slice of the Cincinnati Bengals' zany 58-48 victory over the \n. The second-highest scoring game in NFL history included 49 first downs, 966 yards, big plays almost every time you checked, you name it.\nBrowns owner Randy Lerner ought to keep coach Butch Davis around just on the off-chance he can stage another entertaining shootout of this ilk. Of course, he won't, and that's because the Browns were on the wrong end of the shootout.\nBrowns backup quarterback \n has now authored three 400-yard games in his career. And lost all three of them. Bengals quarterback \n, one of the few guys in the league still throwing consistently from a seven-step drop, tossed four touchdown passes but was nearly undone by three interceptions.\nIn the end, as goofy as this seems, it was a couple cornerbacks who made a difference. The Bengals tandem of \n and Deltha O'Neal made enough plays to stem the tide. James, who has been resurrected in Cincinnati, now has a career-best seven interceptions for the season. And O'Neal, essentially plucked off the scrap heap after Broncos coach Mike Shanahan tried to convert the former first-rounder into a wide receiver, secured the victory with a \"pick\" and 31-yard interception return for a touchdown.\nThis one, ESPN viewers, should be deemed one of those \"instant classics\" and aired every night this week.\nOne personal note: Congrats to \n, the Browns tight end who had three touchdown grabs among his career-best seven catches. We've known Heiden for years and he's one of the class acts, although no one knows it, in the league.\n\nTake a bow Wade\n\nComing off a 34-31 nail-biter in which not a lot of defense was played, the timing might be a bit incongruous, but kudos to San Diego defensive coordinator Wade Phillips are long overdue, so we're taking this opportunity to offer them.\nMuch has been written, and justifiably so, about the high-octane Chargers offense, an attack in which quarterback \n has now thrown 18 touchdown passes and just one interception over the last eight games. Hardly coincidence, right, that the first-place Chargers, who can pretty much bury rival Denver with a win at home next Sunday, have won seven of the eight outings. But the San Diego defense, which statistically ranked No. 27 in 2003 and was 11th going into Sunday's victory at Kansas City, needs to take a bow as well.\nAnd at center stage should be Phillips, whose 3-4 front has been much better than anticipated. There were a few skeptics, yours truly included, who felt that installing the 3-4 in San Diego would be a mistake. The rationale: The defense would take the Chargers two best front seven players, tackle \n and linebacker \n, and badly diminish their playmaking skills. Making the active Williams a nose tackle meant he would just be drawing double-teams all the time. And moving Edwards to an inside position, after he had been so good at both the weak-side and strong-side spots in the past, figured to negate his ability to play in space and run to the ball.\nSo much for punditry. Williams has been able to absorb punishment and still dish it out and, while stuffing things inside, still gets some push on the pocket. As for Edwards, well, he made the interception Sunday that led to Nate Kaeding's game-winning field goal and had 10 tackles. Edwards doesn't make quite as many big plays as he did, but he has become comfortable in the 3-4, and is having a strong season.\nThe other three 'backers -- \n, \n and \n in particular -- have played well and are clearly the strength of Phillips' emerging unit.\n\nRookie runners\n\nBill Parcells and Steve Mariucci have to be asking themselves how their teams' fortunes might have been different if rookie running backs \n (Cowboys) and \n (Lions), respectively, hadn't been banged up much of the season.\nOver the past two weeks, with both finally healthy, the two youngsters rushed for a combined 430 yards (231 for Julius and 199 for Kevin). The four other tailbacks chosen in the first two rounds of the '04 draft -- \n (St. Louis), \n (Cincinnati), \n (Denver) and \n (Jacksonville) -- have a combined 466 yards for the entire season. The later three combined for zero yards this weekend, while Kevin Jones and Julius Jones totaled 249 yards in their Thanksgiving Day appearances.\nKevin Jones has run much harder than most of his critics felt he would. He was pretty much known at Virginia Tech as a bit of a long strider, a guy who would run past people when he got into the secondary, but who had problems creating his own hole.\nParcells took a lot of heat for trading out of the first round when he could have had Jackson, but Julius Jones has demonstrated that Parcells might have been correct to grab the former Notre Dame standout in the second stanza. There are still questions of whether he can hold up physically, at his size, over the course of a 16-game schedule. But Parcells fed him the ball plenty in his two starts and he looked strong.\nPunts\n\n Most erroneous item on some of the Sunday pregame shows was that the loser of the San Francisco-Miami matchup would essentially have a two-game lead in the dubious race for the worst record in the league and, thus, the first overall pick in the 2005 draft. Uh-uh. The 49ers, by virtue of their loss, own a one-game edge over the Dolphins. But losing to Miami means nothing in any potential tiebreaker. What people overlooked is that, in breaking ties for draft position, head-to-head competition isn't a factor. Draft order ties are broken by a strength-of-schedule formula. ... It didn't get much attention on Thanksgiving and, frankly, didn't merit it. But Dallas defensive end \n, the Cowboys' biggest free agent signing on that side of the ball, finally got his first sack of the season. Wiley now has just 10 sacks in his last 41 games. He had 23¬Ω sacks in the 30 previous games. ... Perhaps more notable was that Cowboys end \n had three sacks. Ogbogu, as noted here in the past, is the guy in the much-aired commercial, who exhorts: \"We must protect this house!\" ... The Kansas City wide receivers had just six catches in Sunday's loss to San Diego. ... Chargers quarterback Drew Brees has thrown interceptions in only two of 11 games this season. ... In the past four games, Steelers quarterback \n has just 45 completions and has been sacked 15 times. ... The Pittsburgh defense has surrendered just 209 rushing yards in the last four outings. And in the aggressive scheme of coordinator Dick LeBeau, the Steelers now have 36 sacks, one more than they registered for the entire 2003 season. ... For the second time in three weeks, New Orleans defensive tackle \n, a first-round pick in 2003, was a healthy inactive. Sullivan was seen in the media food line in the press box at the Georgia Dome, grazing before Sunday's game. ... .Another former first-round defensive tackle who was a so-called \"healthy scratch\" on Sunday was \n of Minnesota. It marked the first game Hovan has missed a game in his career, and there is no way the Vikings will try to re-sign the pending free agent. ... After missing three field goals on Sunday, including the potential game-winner, \n could be in big trouble with Bucs coach Jon Gruden. The veteran kicker is just 11 for 19 this year. ...

{"title": "Bears, Cardinals latest to jump starters", "text": "\nAnother week in the NFL and, as has been the case lately, another week of quarterback roulette.\nAs anticipated, three-year veteran \n will start Sunday for the \n, as coach Lovie Smith attempts to locate someone who can provide consistent offense. In a more surprising move, frustrated \n coach Dennis Green will turn to rookie \n, who has yet to play this season, in an effort to jump-start the Cardinals' moribund attack.\nThe two switches will bring to 51 the number of quarterbacks who have started in 2004. With five weeks remaining, this season, which enjoyed stability at quarterback over the first two months, could end up rivaling most recent campaigns. In the last five years, NFL teams used 55 to 60 different starters.\nBarring further changes for next weekend, 17 franchises will have started the same quarterback in every game. Only five quarterbacks have taken every snap for their teams.\nNavarre, 24, was the Cardinals' seventh-round choice in this year's draft, and the former University of Michigan standout replaces \n, who had started, and lost, the last two outings. King replaced \n, who led Arizona to a 4-5 mark as the starter in the first nine contests.\nWhile most league scouts panned Navarre's performances at the combine and in campus workouts last spring, the Cardinals liked his competitiveness, and Green lauded his football acumen in camp. Green acknowledged after Sunday's loss to the \n that he would revisit the quarterback situation and that Navarre would be in the mix. Clearly, Green, who is accustomed to stewarding a high-octane offense, is frustrated by the lack of results in his first season with the Cardinals.\n\"I think John has some special qualities,\" said Green, who shocked many observers with his latest quarterback switch. \"He's a smart quarterback, and he has had a chance to spend a lot of time in our system. He has worked hard and has gained my confidence. ... Shaun had his chance the last couple weeks. A quick hook? Yep. Tough business. And you don't ever have to apologize for it being a tough business.\"\nA three-year starter in college, Navarre posted a 31-11 record with the Wolverines, completing 765 of 1,366 passes for 9,254 yards. He threw 72 touchdown passes and 31 interceptions and established six career and seven single-season school records.\nHutchinson will become the fourth different starter for the Bears, who lost their No. 1 quarterback, \n, to a season-ending knee injury in the third game. \n and \n, in order, replaced Grossman, but both were ineffective. The switch to Hutchinson marks the 26th quarterback change in 87 games for the Bears. The team has used at least three different starters in five of the past six seasons.\nA former Stanford star who left school early to pursue a baseball career, Hutchinson has nine starts, all with the \n in 2002, on his r√©sum√©. He was 2-7 in the starts and has completed 128 of 252 passes for 1,563 yards in his career, with seven touchdown passes and eight interceptions.\nSigned by the Bears as a free agent after his release by the Cowboys this summer, Hutchinson has yet to play in a game this season. He acknowledged earlier in the year that he was having difficulty digesting the playbook of coordinator Terry Shea, but said over the weekend that he is prepared to play now.\n\"I haven't run any plays out there, but I feel good with it on paper,\" Hutchinson said. \"I've had two months to look at it, and to take mental 'reps,' and now it's a matter of just taking the physical 'reps.' I'm ready.\"\nSounding ready to back up Hutchinson is newly signed Jeff George, who has not played since early in the 2001 season.\nAs ESPN.com reported Saturday, the free-agent quarterback has signed a one-year contract to return to the NFL. Financial details were not immediately available, but it is anticipated that the contract is for the league minimum of $760,000, prorated over the final five games of this season.\n\n\"I'm just excited to be back in it. It's a great opportunity for me, and I'm very thankful for them bringing me in,\" George said after his first practice with his new team. \"Whatever role the Bears want me to do, I'm willing to do that. I can't say enough how happy I am and how thankful I am to be out here.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1934386"},

{"title": "QB continues to triumph amid adversity", "text": "\nSometimes, when the sky is falling in pieces all around you, all you can do is laugh.\nA week ago, \n was needling his mother, Bonita, who was in the middle of a book tour to publicize her New York Times best-seller \"Favre.\"\n\"You're not a spring chicken anymore,\" the \n quarterback told her.\n\"You sound like I sounded some years back, talking to you,\" she responded.\n\"Well, if that's the case,\" the son told his mother, \"then you won't listen to me like I didn't listen to you -- so we're even.\"\nOne day later, Bonita was flat on her back in a Madison, Wis., hospital complaining of severe stomach pains. And with that piece of bad luck -- food poisoning was ultimately the diagnosis -- her streak of consecutive book signings was stopped at seven. Bonita sat out the signings scheduled for La Crosse on Thursday and Green Bay on Saturday.\nHer publicist, Zoe Feigenbaum, insisted she would continue this week.\n\"She's a tough one,\" Feigenbaum observed. \"She wants to keep going.\n\"She's a Favre.\"\nIndeed.\nIn his 13th season with the Packers, Brett Lorenzo Favre has become synonymous with triumphing amid adversity. In sport, courage and heroism are often overstated. But the depths of the adversity that has visited Favre's life and the level of performance with which he has responded is, upon inspection, quite breathtaking.\nIn the last 11 months, Favre has lost his father, Irv, to a heart attack; lost his brother-in-law, Casey Tynes, in an all-terrain vehicle crash on his estate in Mississippi; and learned that his wife, Deanna, had breast cancer. Favre has played through a series of injuries this season -- concussion, bruised hamstring, sprained hand, sprained thumb -- but on Monday night he will step on Lambeau Field against the \n and start his 200th consecutive game, an amazing NFL record he continues to push further and further out of reach. By any measure, Favre's success under duress surpasses all understanding.\nHow does he consistently rise to these great occasions with such poise and precision?\nLast week, Favre sat down for an introspective interview with ESPN's Suzy Kolber for an NFL Countdown feature.\n\"I wish I had an answer,\" Favre told Kolber. \"I don't know. The most talented players don't always succeed. It's more what's inside. So much of a professional athlete's success depends not necessarily how you deal with good, but how you deal with the bad.\n\"It was kind of a wake-up call. When it hits you directly, it makes you realize how precious life is. There was a time when I thought football was the most important. Football will be over at some point -- the family goes on.\n\"When you lose someone, or when there are setbacks, it kind of puts it in perspective. When you lose a family member or something tragic happens, that stays with you forever. You never get over it.\"\nFavre is 35, already graying gracefully around the temples. His place in football history is more than secure. He's led his team to a Super Bowl victory and is ranked among the top five in four major passing categories: touchdowns, attempts, completions and yards. He has thrown for 365 touchdowns, meaning only Dan Marino (420) has more. Think of all the territory that takes in; Favre has seen his passes reach the end zone safely more times than Elway, Unitas, Montana's and so many other great quarterbacks.\nBut it isn't the quantity he producers year after year, it is the sterling quality of his numbers when things are less than perfect. Some of his finest seasons came when he was, by his own admission, drinking too much. He won the first of three NFL MVP awards while he was addicted to painkillers in 1995. There have been memorable contests when Favre entered games listed as questionable with formidable injuries.\n\"You just never know what the next day is going to bring,\" Favre told Kolber. \"That goes for football, goes for off the field, and I gave up a long time ago trying to predict the future and trying to deal with things I couldn't deal with. There is only so much I can do. You know, the old saying, when it rains, it pours. When it comes, it comes in bunches. It seems that way in my case.\n\"I have been asked the question, 'How do you focus on football with everything else going on?' I would think it's much easier. It enables you to escape for a brief period of time to kind of get away. You have to go back and deal with it, but it's a good escape.\"\nLast Dec. 21, Irv Favre, 58, died of a heart attack while driving near his home. The Packers were 8-6 and competing fiercely for a playoff berth. Twenty-six hours later, under the bright lights of national television, Favre memorably torched the \n for 399 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-7 victory.\nFavre led Green Bay to a 31-3 victory over the \n in the regular-season finale, then guided the Packers to a 33-27 overtime win over Seattle in the first round of the playoffs. Favre couldn't quite carry the team past the \n in the divisional playoffs, when Green Bay fell, 20-17 in overtime.\nBefore the season, Favre said he thought the Packers were committed to reaching the Super Bowl, but Green Bay responded by losing four straight games after an opening victory at Carolina. The last of those losses, at home to Tennessee, was a game colored by more grief for Favre. On Oct. 6, Tynes was killed in an ATV accident in Hattiesburg, Miss. He was 24.\nEight days later, Favre discovered that Deanna has breast cancer. She had found a lump during a self-examination.\n\"I know that I handled it worse than she did,\" Favre told Kolber. \"Learning of her diagnosis was like \"Ah, where do we go from here?' I'm sure that deep down inside, she was probably really scared, and probably still is.\n\"But I felt helpless and still feel helpless. I want to go in and cure it right now -- I can't do that -- and that's pretty much the most difficult part.\"\nThree days after the diagnosis, the Packers were 1-4 and playing at Detroit. If ever there was a chance for a distracted performance, this was it. Favre was polished and professional; he completed 25 of 38 passes for 257 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. The Packers won, 38-10.\nTwo days before the game against Dallas the following week, Deanna underwent a lumpectomy Oct. 22 at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Favre responded with another terrific game against the Cowboys, completing 23 of 29 passes for 258 yards and two more touchdowns. Since then, Favre has been a bit uneven -- he threw three interceptions against the Redskins, but burned the Vikings for four touchdowns -- but the Packers are riding a five-game winning streak.\nThe most recent triumph, a gritty 16-13 victory over the \n, was typical Favre. The young Texans led 13-3 in the fourth quarter, but Favre rallied the Packers with three scoring drives. \n's 46-yard field goal as time expired followed a drive in which Favre completed six of seven passes -- the only miss being an intentional spike to stop the clock.\nPackers head coach Mike Sherman said Favre, \"gives you the confidence that he is going to do something special in those situations.\"\nThis has been the most difficult of his 14 NFL seasons, according to Favre. Tougher than 1999, when he played most of the season with an injured thumb and the Packers missed the playoffs with an 8-8 record. Tougher than last season when he played with a broken thumb and his father died.\nThese days, he and his daughters, 15-year-old Brittany and five-year-old Breleigh, are rallying around Deanna, who is still confronted by three months of chemotherapy and six weeks of radiation treatment. The prognosis after early detection, however, is optimistic.\n\"My wife is healthy, she's in the prime of her life,\" Favre said. \"You think that it happens to other people, but it happens to everyone. God, he deals you with some blows that at some times you think you can't handle -- and there have been some things in the last year that we thought we couldn't handle -- but we've dealt with it up until this point.\"\nHave these travails affected the choice between continuing to play or retire?\n\"(Deanna) keeps saying, 'Don't worry about me -- keep playing.' \" Favre told Kolber. \"I don't foresee my wife saying to me that it's time to give it up unless I just really suck, pardon my French.\n\"But there's times that I walk on and off the field thinking I'm the best and when things like the loss of my dad and Deanna's diagnosis and the loss of her brother come about, you go, 'God, I don't know if I've got it anymore. I don't know if I can go out there and lead us through the two-minute drill anymore.'\n\"I've got other things to worry about and (Deanna) says they're going to be there either way, so why not do something that you know you can do? She has said to me numerous times this year, 'I don't know if this is your last year or what, but it's your decision. I want you to play the best you've ever played,' which is probably putting more pressure on me than I can deal with because I don't know if I can play as good as I've played in the past.\n\"But I've told her that I would give it a try. There's still a lot of football to play, and we've fought our way back, so we'll see what happens.\"", "url": "http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=1930089"},

And people are going to pat you on the back and say \"I'm sorry, I don't know how you do it\" ¬Ö But if you don't produce at some point they are going to replace you and I don't want that to happen until I'm ready to go. So, I'm not going to let ¬Ö I say I'm not going to let anything stop me.\n And having a strong family, you know we've lost some members of our family and had some setbacks, but I think a good family and kids all those things I thought at one time ¬Ö you got to be kidding me ¬Ö Those things are so important they enable you to go on.\n Well family is obviously the most important. There was a time when I thought football was the most important. Football will be over at some point, the family goes on.  When you lose someone, or when there are setbacks, it kind of puts it in perspective. You can lose a game but, I see guys every week including myself, you lose a game, it's a tough loss, you're down, two weeks later you forgot about it. You know it's amazing how down you were, but all of the sudden you're like it never happened. But when you lose a family member or something tragic happens, that stays with you forever. You never get over it. Knowing that you have to deal with that for the rest of your life\n ¬Ö Football is important, but not as important as you once thought it was.\n Well, I think back, it's difficult for me to even think back to the way I once was. And, I am often reminded by players on the team. For example \n), on Wednesday I guess it was, walked on the practice field. He said I saw some footage of you on NFL Films or something, and you were on some balcony and it looked like you had a beer. And you were doing all these chants ¬Ö And he said, \"I told my wife that wasn't you\" ¬Ö I said, \"that probably was me.\" He said, \"I can't imagine you being that way.\" I said, \"I can't either.\"  It's been six years since I have had a drink and I have two girls, and my priorities are a lot different now and I just can't believe I was that guy. And I would not go back, I would not trade the way I am now for anything. I'm not perfect. My wife, she still gives me a hard time, and says I hunt too much or I like to play golf too much. And she's probably right, but it sure beats some of the things I used to do. I can't believe I survived, not only my life, but I am still playing football 'cause half of those eight or nine years I don't even remember. I do, but I don't. It's kind of like, \"I did that?\" I don't miss it one bit. Life deals you a lot lessons, some people learn from it, some people don't. Once again I am not perfect, but I thought there was one time when Brett Favre would always drink and be this crazy guy, I thought I would never change. If I can change than anyone can change. I promise you that.\n I'm pretty boring really. I consider myself more of a loner now and I think when you get older, especially in this game, and just talking with other players who have come and gone, I see what they were saying when I was a young guy in the locker room. You want to know what's going on, you want to be buddies with everyone, you want to find your place on the team and that comes from play, earning respect and now that I've earned my respect and found my place on this team ¬Ö I don't really care what's going on I just care about getting my job done the best that I can possibly do and deal with the other things in my life that take a lot of time and a lot of thought. I don't worry anymore about where's the big hangout Tuesday night, Friday. Couldn't tell you and no one comes to me for advice anymore in those areas anymore, so real boring I would say. Most guys wouldn't want to hang out with me anyway ¬Ö \"why are you walking in the woods or sitting in a tree all day?\" It's not so much about killing an animal, it's being at peace and you don't have to worry about all the other things that go on. That's a couple of hours a week that you get to escape but it's nice to do that.\n\n\n I don't want to bring anyone else down. I want to bring everybody else up and the way that you see me on the football field is the is the way that I am at home. The party now is having my kids laugh and my wife laugh and my teammates. I want them to see me have fun and put it in a different way.\n Well even before she was diagnosed with the cancer, I would have said that she was a lot tougher than me and most guys would probably say that about their wives and it's probably true in most cases. But you know in my case with my wife, we go back to grade school and I always tell people that she was there way before my first touchdown pass ¬Ö She's excited when I do it, but that's not why she's around and to put up with me I could only imagine how difficult that has been and will continue to be. I'm so hard headed and I don't want to listen and she's been very patient and I always say, \"you know I could break a thumb, sprained ankles, break whatever but I could never have a child.\" How women do it I have no idea and to bounce right back and to put up with all the things that we put 'em through and to deal with kids. I saw a a special with \n one day and I saw where he and Holly had exchanged duties for a day and he was going crazy by the end of the day. I think it was on Oprah and I said \"thank God\" that was him and not me. I couldn't do it and she, women are a lot tougher in different ways but mentally she's, she's as strong as there is.\n She would probably not sit here and tell you that she was instrumental in the main reason why I changed, but she really is and I told her that and she thinks it's all talk. \nAnyone who's ever drank or had a vice they said, \"I'll quit\" and they usually go back to it and I was no different. And she said numerous times, \"OK this is it\" and then she said it again and then one time she said, \"this is it\" and I believed it. It was one of those like your parents and they finally say something and it's like OK you can't push them anymore and that's basically what happened to us and from that point on it was difficult at first to change my ways and I figured once I quit drinking it would be easy and I had to change who I hung out with and what I did in my spare time and that took a while to kind of mold and it was all basically because of her. She was pregnant with our second child and I knew I didn't want to be a deadbeat dad or deadbeat husband.\n God only knows I'm glad that I don't have to worry about that. People always ask the question, \"what if you stayed in Atlanta?\" \"what if ¬Ö\". Fortunately in my life I don't have to worry about that. That's kind of how I approach life and football; why dwell on something that's hasn't happened. There's a lot of \"what ifs\" if you sit down and think about it, but she stuck with me thank goodness and it's always nice to have someone to go home to ¬Ö someone to listen to you and tell you it's not as bad as you think it is and that's the key to the whole thing.\n Initially, I know that I handled it worse than she did and I think partly because I've always been ¬Ö every bit of adversity I've faced up until the last year and a half is adversity I brought upon myself -- or the opposing teams have given me.  \n Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose but I could control that adversity and how I dealt with it and in the last year it's been something that I can't control and it was obviously one thing after another and learning of her diagnoses was like where do we go from here and \"not another blow\" and I'm sure deep down inside she was probably really scared and probably still is ¬Ö rightfully so, but I felt helpless and still feel helpless and you can give support and that's basically it and I want to go in and cure it right now and I can't do that. That's pretty much the most difficult part.\n Well, I think every person including people that will watch this interview  because I was one one of those people who watched an interview and read something in the paper and thought \"wow that's a shame that that happened to them\" and you see all the things that go along with it but until it hits you personally it's just talk. It makes you realize how precious life is and it can strike anyone. I've spent a lot of time with Make-a-Wish kids and my mom was a special ed teacher so she was always around special kids and you feel for them and all that but you go \"thank goodness it's not directly related to my family.\" Then once it is, you know it could happen to anyone. My wife is healthy, she's in the prime of her life and you think that it happens to other people but it happens to everyone and at some point in everyone's life they're going to have to deal with something ¬Ö some earlier than later and I promise you it will happen and I was surprised by it. I think everyone will be surprised by it and how you deal with it remains to be seen. God, he deals you blows that at sometimes you think you can't handle and \nin the last year there have been things that we thought we couldn't handle but we've dealt with it up until this point\n.\n She keeps saying don't worry about me, keep playing and I don't ever foresee my wife saying to me that it's time to give it up unless I just really suck ¬Ö pardon my french. But there's times\n I walk on and off the field thinking I'm the best and when things like the loss of my dad and Deanna's diagnoses and the loss of her brother come about ¬Ö you go, \"God I don't know if I got it anymore.\" I don't know if I can go out there and lead us through the two-minute drill anymore. I got other things to worry about and she says they're going to be there either way so why not do something that you know you can do. And as she said numerous times this year \"I don't know if this is your last year or what that's your decision, but I want you to play the best you've ever played\" which is probably putting more pressure on me than I can deal with 'cause I don't know if I can play as good as I've played in the past but I've told her that I would give it a try. I haven't made a lot of decisions yet and there's still a lot of football to play and we've fought our way back so we'll see what happens.\n Well I would say that we're regular people first of all and we're normal and it's obvious by some of the things that have happened just because our name is famous we're not immune to tragedy. We've always considered ourselves regular people willing to help others and strong and I didn't realize how strong and I hope every family out there doesn't have to go through what we've gone through and there are families out there that have obviously had to get through worse but you can get through it and you don't realize how strong and how united you are until those times. I think in our family's case, we just reassured ourselves how strong we are.\n Her prognosis is good. We caught it early ¬Ö and I've learned a lot about breast cancer in the last two months and early detection is key as with most forms of cancer. She has one of the most aggressive, but it's very treatable but one of the most common and the most treated so it's seen the most and they know how to deal with it and so you just wish for the best and how you react to the medication and treatment is crucial.\n Well she had setback as well. Two weeks ago she was admitted to the hospital with chest pains back home during our bye week and you could only imagine how I felt and how my family felt, but by the time I got home she was fine.\n Well on the plane coming in tonight, I had several of the guys ask me how my mother was. I don't think everyone knew and I'm sure not everyone knows but a couple of guys are like, \"man what else\" and I said \"don't say that because just when you think it's done, there's something else but that's life.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1930185"},

{"title": "DBs score twice in rout of Texans", "text": "\nThe Colts are well aware of the perception that they're a one-dimensional team. And their statistical rankings on offense (third) and defense (31st) certainly support that notion. However, with the emergence of a few first-year defensive backs, coach Tony Dungy expects the defense to improve during the season's second half.\nCornerbacks \n and \n and free safety \n combined for 20 tackles, an interception, a fumble recovery and two touchdowns during the Colts' 49-21 victory over Houston on Sunday.\n\"I thought our young guys showed up (Sunday),\" Dungy said. \"(Sanders) and Von did a good job, and (rookie cornerback) Jason David. Bob is a big-play guy, and that's what we were looking for when we drafted him.\"\nEssentially, the Colts have been looking for someone on defense aside from third-year end \n to consistently make plays. Yet, they had been unable to count on such playmaking from Sanders for much of the campaign. The second-rounder from Iowa missed all of training camp in a contract dispute, then needed time to rehabilitate a stress fracture in his foot.\nSanders didn't make his debut until Week 8, but registered nine tackles in the loss to Kansas City. He made his first start a week later and had five tackles in the win over Minnesota. But it wasn't until the rout over Houston in which Sanders made a \"big play.\"\nWith Indy already ahead 28-0 in the third quarter, Sanders returned a \n fumble 37 yards for his first touchdown.\n\"He's a monster out there,\" cornerback \n said of Sanders. \"All he wants to do is make plays. He's learning the defense, but he's tremendous. My hat's off to him.\"\nAnd with the Colts well on their way to their sixth victory, Hutchins padded the score.\nThe sixth-rounder from Mississippi returned a Carr interception 77 yards in the fourth quarter to provide the final tally.\nThis season, the Colts have scored three touchdowns on returns. The first was David's 34-yard interception return in a Week 5 win over the Raiders.\n:\nLike his alma mater Auburn in the collegiate polls and BCS Standings, Dansby is coming on strong. The second-rounder had a pair of sacks and also knocked down a pass on Sunday as the Cardinals knocked off the Giants. Dansby is now tied for second on the team with four sacks.\nMonday night was not a good one for the undrafted free agent from West Virginia. Frazier, assuming a new role on special teams, muffed his first punt return of the night, but recovered it. Later in the period after the Cowboys forced a three-and-out, Frazier muffed another punt and this one was recovered by the Eagles. Four plays later, the Eagles scored on a \n run to go up 14-0. And if that was enough, he was hit in the helmet by \n's knee during a tackle and banged his right elbow into teammate \n's knee during a scramble for a lose ball.\nThe first-rounder from Oregon State had one of his more productive games as the Rams completed a season sweep of the Seahawks. Jackson helped continue St. Louis' fast start with a four-yard scoring run in the first quarter for a 14-0 lead and finished with 47 yards on 10 carries as Rams accumulated 202 rushing yards.\n\nThe third-rounder from Purdue was a major contributor to the Bengals winning their first game away from home this year. Johnson registered his first career sack with 11:49 to go in the third quarter and had a team-high nine tackles in the win over Washington.\nHe's not as heralded and his numbers aren't as flashy, but the Ohio State alumnus has something in common with Pittsburgh's \n -- he's still undefeated as a starter. Krenzel completed just 10 of 28 passes and threw two interceptions, but was the recipient of great defensive and special teams performances as the Bears defeated Tennessee in overtime for their third straight win. \"There's still a great amount of hope in Craig Krenzel that he gives this offense,\" offensive coordinator Terry Shea said. \"He makes things happen with his feet. ¬Ö He's just got to learn from this point to complement what our defense is doing so well and not give the ball back.\"\nThe first-rounder from Texas continues to play, but not have an overwhelming impact on the offense because of a bad ankle.

{"title": "QB changes come fast and furious", "text": "\nThe times, they are a-changin' in the NFL.\nAnd so are the quarterbacks.\n\nWith three more changes in lineups leaguewide for this upcoming weekend's game -- \n (again) in Miami, \n for Washington and \n for the \n -- the number of different starters used this season will rise to 45. Based on the previous five seasons, when franchises consistently used 55-60 different starters, that number is hardly alarming.\nBut what is notable, as manifested in all three of this week's depth chart alterations, is the increasing trend toward making changes because of performance and not attrition. Time was when most coaches eschewed replacing their starting quarterback, unless the change was dictated by injury, but that is no longer the case in many precincts.\nIt is hardly to the point yet where quarterbacks are as disposable as Kleenex, but the 2004 season is becoming one in which the long-term vision of some frustrated coaches doesn't extend much beyond the tip of their nose. At a position that once defined stability around the NFL, things are shakier than at any point in recent memory, and quarterbacks are now being viewed with transient perspective.\n\n\"We haven't gotten to a 'what have you done for me lately' mentality,\" said one general manager whose team has started the same quarterback in each of its nine games. \"But we are definitely seeing guys get the hook quicker now than I can remember. It's definitely notable how many changes there have been that weren't injury related.\"\nCounting the changes already announced for this weekend, there have been 17 starting quarterback switches in 2004, including multiple ones for teams like Miami, where \n has now gotten the hook for a second time. Of those 17 changes, eight were based on performance, and not attrition.\nThere were only 10 non-injury related changes for all of 2003 and just eight the season before that. To have eight performance-based benchings, and be barely beyond the mid-point of the season, is reflective of a rising impatience around the league. Coaches are less inclined now to allow a quarterback to play his way out of a slump and are more convinced now that changing quarterbacks could change their teams' fortunes.\n\nEven the intransigent Joe Gibbs, who stuck with \n though his starter was the NFL's most inaccurate passer in an offense that has yet to score 20 points in any outing, finally conceded the obvious this week. Ramsey will return to the starting job with which he opened the 2003 season under then-Redskins coach Steve Spurrier.\nThe litany of quarterbacks benched for incompetence and not injury -- a group including former Super Bowl winner \n, two-time league most valuable player \n, and onetime AFC passing leader Brunell -- is growing. And, with seven weeks remaining on the schedule, there are apt to be some additions.\n of Buffalo, Detroit's \n, Dallas' \n and \n of Cleveland could all be benched for the end of the season. Lions coach Steve Mariucci, in fact, acknowledged the disappointing Harrington is being closely scrutinized and that backup \n will get increased practice snaps.\nQuarterbacks used to move into the lineup and sink their roots as deep as a redwood.

{"title": "Timing of move to Manning curious", "text": "\nThe talk radio, water cooler buzz had already congealed into a wall of white noise by the time Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi returned the phone call. It was almost exactly 24 hours after head coach Tom Coughlin made the announcement that \n was being benched and rookie \n would start at quarterback in Sunday's game against the \n.\nAccorsi was asked Tuesday afternoon about the perception in some quarters that the Giants have written off the playoffs by giving the ball to Manning.\n\"We're not 2-7,\" Accorsi said, clearly agitated. \"We're 5-4 and first in the race for the playoffs. We didn't do this to develop Eli Manning. We did it -- Coach made the decision -- because he thought it gave us the best chance of winning.\n\"You don't think people think we're doing this to develop him for next year? That's absurd. If we wanted to go that way, we would have started him at the beginning of the season. Perception? He gives us the best chance of winning. Anyone who thinks you'd give the season up, well, they never competed in their life.\"\nThe revelation came, apparently, at 3 a.m. Monday on the couch in Coughlin's Giants Stadium office. Some 205 days after Manning was the No. 1 overall choice in the NFL draft, Coughlin said he came to the inevitable conclusion that Manning would start.\n\"He is the future of the \n -- it just starts now,\" the coach said later Monday. \"I really felt the last four games we haven't been playing well offensively. We just need to make a change.\"\nWarner, as Coughlin noted, did not lose the job. Rather, the 33-year-old two-time MVP was collateral damage in a four-game implosion that took the Giants from a 4-1 start to the present 5-4. Losses to Detroit, Chicago and Arizona -- all, a murky 4-5 -- moved Coughlin to make the switch.\nWhen a team is going bad in baseball, it is far easier to fire the manager than all 25 players under his command. Likewise, Coughlin couldn't replace the five offensive linemen responsible for the 39 times Warner was sacked -- an astounding 24 times in the last four games.\n\"No matter who is at the quarterback position, if we don't get a more solid performance in pass protection out of our offensive line, tight end and running backs,\" Coughlin said, \"it's not going to make a whole lot of difference.\"\nCoughlin denied that management -- namely, Accorsi and co-owner Wellington Mara -- had anything to do with the decision.\nIn fact, Mara was moved to issue a statement that read, \"I don't think Tom Coughlin would work for an organization that made player decisions for him.\"\n\"I think it goes way beyond [the Cardinals] game,\" Warner said. \"We can read into that as much as we want. There's a bigger picture here, and there are more things that are trying to be accomplished here, and that's why the decision was made.\"\nThis decision could not possibly have been based strictly on football, could it?\nManning, who is only slightly more mobile than Warner, has completed three of nine passes for 66 yards in two regular-season games. Warner has played in 63 career regular-season games, completing 1,289 of 1,956 passes for 16,374 yards and 108 touchdowns. Those numbers don't include seven playoff games that include two Super Bowl appearances.\nClearly, Coughlin has been consumed with this decision since the Giants traded the rights to \n, the No. 4 overall pick, and three other draft choices to the \n for Manning's rights. There is never a good time to start a rookie quarterback, but heading into the season there was a logical spot: the Week 9 and 10 games against Chicago and Arizona. But when Warner played beyond expectations and led the Giants to an uplifting 34-13 victory at Minnesota, Coughlin couldn't sack the quarterback of a 5-2 team that seemed destined for the playoffs.\nTwo weeks later, the Giants blew leads of 14-0 and 14-3 and lost to teams quarterbacked by \n and \n. And so, the 23-year-old rookie with a six-year, $54.6 million contract will start his first NFL game. While rookie quarterbacks are a remarkable 10-0 this season -- Pittsburgh's \n is 7-0 and Chicago's Krenzel is 3-0 -- there is little to suggest that Manning will be any more effective than Warner was.\nThe timing for Manning appears to be, well, problematic.\nFor not only do the Falcons and \n have the best two records in the NFC, at 7-2 and 8-1, respectively, but they also have two of the best pass rushes. The Eagles are tied for first (with Pittsburgh and Baltimore) with 28 sacks. The Falcons are next with 27. Philadelphia will send \n (six sacks) and \n (five), while the Falcons will launch \n (eight sacks) and \n (six). It is worth noting that the Giants have allowed an astounding 40 sacks, seven more than any other team. Even with his 12 fumbles, Warner has vastly more experience to deal with that kind of pressure.\nThe Manning-Warner story dominated the New York sports scene Monday and Tuesday and is likely to do so for the rest of the week. As WFAN's Mike Francesa noted, \"They can't block anybody. If they couldn't do it for four weeks -- how do you expect them to do it now? The kid needs more help than Warner.\"\nToo true. The Giants' offensive line has managed to make ordinary players look like the second coming of Lawrence Taylor. In back-to-back games, the Cardinals' \n and the Bears' \n recorded four sacks apiece. Based on those numbers, Kerney could get six.\nIs Accorsi concerned about the porous nature of the offensive line?\n\"Certainly you are,\" Accorsi said. \"The last couple of games ... you can't play that way.\"\n\"Ridiculous,\" is how left tackle \n described the blocking after losing at Arizona. \"We got complacent. I don't know what else to say. I don't know what's happening.\"\nThis may be Manning's state of mind after 60 minutes with a pretty good football team from Atlanta. The tenuous state of the offensive line not only puts pressure on him, but on \n and the rest of the skill-position players. Barber -- 220 touches, 1,391 yards and 10 touchdowns -- is having a magnificent season but he has already carried an enormous load. Wide receivers \n and \n have yet to catch a touchdown pass and tight end \n doesn't spend enough time running patterns because he's kept in to help with the blocking.\nIs it panic? A sound personnel decision? Or is it merely getting on with the cold-hearted business of business? After the Eagles and Falcons, there isn't much to choose from in the NFC. While there are eight teams at 6-3 or better in the AFC, the Giants, as Accorsi pointed out, are tied with four other teams for the NFC's third-best record, 5-4.\nAccorsi has been in and around the NFL for 35 years now. He was the Baltimore Colts' public relations director when Bert Jones was drafted second overall in 1973. He was the Colts' general manager when the team drafted John Elway first overall in 1983. He was the general manager in Cleveland when the Browns maneuvered to secure the rights to Bernie Kosar in 1985. It was Accorsi who engineered the trade for Manning.\n\"If someone gets hurt, it's no longer a coach's decision,\" Accorsi said. \"That's how \n got in, it happened with Roethlisberger and \n, too.\n\"It was the same thing with Kosar. We traded for Gary Danielson and figured he'd play the 1985 season. But then he got hurt and Kosar had to play. His role was fairly custodial, and then Danielson came back. But then he got hurt again and Kosar had to start the playoff game. The next year, when we won the division, there was no doubt he was ready to play.\"\nThis time, however, there is no injury. Just the gnawing sense that Eli Manning -- bless his $20 million signing bonus -- \n ready to play.\n\"You never know what's going to happen,\" Accorsi said. \"But I'm sure he'll be judged by the writers on his first game -- just like his first [disappointing] mini-camp. It's early in the curve. You really don't know what's going to happen.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=garber_greg&id=1924156"},

{"title": "Defense starts fast, doesn't let up", "text": "\nINDIANAPOLIS -- At the halfway point in each of his first two seasons here, \n coach Tony Dungy insisted that his defenses characteristically improve once the calendar turns to November and the playoff stretch run commences.\nThat wasn't quite the case in 2002 or in 2003 but, in a suffocating performance during Sunday's 49-14 rout of the allegedly emerging \n, the Colts defense might well have served notice that this season will be different. Indeed, if the third time around is a charm, the Colts defense sounded an ear-splitting alarm in transforming quarterback \n and his Houston offensive teammates into overmatched scrimmage partners.\nSpeed kills, and while the Indianapolis offense validates that hackneyed notion on a near weekly basis, its undersized defensive counterparts delivered a loud message about its own brand of quickness on Sunday by playing the entire contest in overdrive.\nOn the first defensive snap of the second half of the season, Colts right end \n roared around Texans left offensive tackle \n and mercilessly unloaded on Carr, just as he set up in the pocket. Carr lost the ball and, although the officials ruled that the play was a forward pass and not a fumble (the first of many dubious calls in a game where the zebras were conspicuous to the point of nettlesome), the tone was set. The Texans' developing young quarterback was suddenly a \n and the Colts front seven broke out their whipping sticks.\n\"The \n play, man, Dwight comes in and smashes (Carr), and its like, 'OK, guys, the sack parade is on.' It definitely got things rolling. We were confident coming in here that we were playing better, that we were starting to pick it up, and that we were set to have a good game. But that was like pouring gasoline on the fire,\" said Colts weak-side linebacker \n, who recorded a game-high 13 tackles and two of his team's eight passed defensed.\nWe don't want to dwell too much on Freeney jump-starting the Indianapolis defensive effort because, after we suggested in print last week that the third-year veteran dominated Minnesota standout left tackle \n in the Monday night victory here, a top Colts official publicly took us to task for that assessment. Maybe next time, we'll take the easy cop-out route, and tell the boss we can't write until after we review the videotape.\nTruth be told, though, no one needed to resort to celluloid documentation here on Sunday to understand that the Colts defense played with the kind of warp-speed Dungy expects from his unit. And that the Texans at times, especially on the offensive line, were more like mannequins trying to block the high-energy Indianapolis front.\nIn all, the Colts sacked Carr five times, and forced him into three interceptions and also three fumbles. Rookie strong safety \n, the second-round draft pick who started his second game in a row, turned one of the fumbles into a 37-yard touchdown return. The final Indianapolis touchdown came on a 77-yard interception return by rookie corner \n, a sixth-round draft choice.\nThe two scores boosted the number of defensive touchdowns for the Colts to three for the season, and there could be more to come, especially if the Indianapolis front seven plays with the kind of eye-blink speed it manifested in the team's second straight victory.\nIt is easy, and somewhat justifiable, to chastise the Colts defense, which entered the game statistically ranked 31st in the league. But had the NFL opted to stage a track meet here on Sunday, matching up the myriad of offensive weapons possessed by a Houston offense that was No. 8 in the league against the Indianapolis defense, the outcome might have been as lopsided as the final score.\nThe Colts were here, there and everywhere against the Texans. At least a step quicker on virtually every play. Almost always faster to the point of attack. Particularly notable was the performance of \"nickel\" defensive end \n, the second-year rush specialist who posted three sacks, and forced all three of Carr's fumbles.\nAligned against right tackle \n, playing in place of the injured \n, and benefiting from the fact the Texans usually played their tight end on the other side to chip on Freeney on passing plays, Mathis certainly personified the huge speed advantage enjoyed throughout by the Indianapolis defense. With the bull's eye squarely on Carr, all the Colts down linemen took turns harassing the Texans young star.\nBeyond the five sacks he suffered, Carr was knocked down at least five more times, and unofficially, 13 of his 41 pass attempts (not counting bootlegs) came when he was flushed from the pocket and forced to throw on the run. Nearly as impressive as the Indianapolis pass rush was the play of its entire front seven versus the run.\nOn his first seven rushes, tailback \n eked out a measly eight yards. And of his 98 yards for the afternoon, 75 came after the Colts led 35-0 early in the third quarter, and played relatively soft upfront the rest of the day.\n\"They were fast, really fast, into the hole sometimes before I got there,\" Davis allowed. \"It's tough to play anyone when you get that far (behind). But their defense plays a step quicker when it's playing with a lead. And they seem a step quicker at home. They were flying all over the place, getting to the ball, making plays.\"\nDungy acknowledged that his players feel faster on the antiquated AstroTurf carpet of the RCA Dome and several defenders agreed. Never mind that \n teams ought to be a step quicker here, too, because the road-runner Colts usually enjoy a psychological edge at home as well. And Dungy, who built a Super Bowl-caliber defense in Tampa Bay with smaller and quicker players, plays right into that.\n\"The last two weeks, our speed has shown up,\" conceded Dungy. \"We would like to be able to use our speed.\"\nWith the offense scoring on three of its first five possessions, and quarterback \n tossing five touchdown passes for a third time this season as he continues on a pace to destroy Dan Marino's touchdown pass record, the Indianapolis defense was able to pin back its ears and attack the line of scrimmage. The only two Houston touchdowns, in fact, came after uncharacteristic Manning interceptions, on possessions that started in Colts territory.\n\"I just think we like being in that attack mode,\" said Mathis, a far better pass rusher than he is a talker. \"When we're able to use our speed, it's tough to keep us from penetrating, really. But the bottom line is, if you can't run, you can't play this defense. It's made for guys like me. It's made to put pressure on the other guy. I mean, speed forces you into a lot of mistakes, and we saw that today. Now we want to keep showing people that speed.\"\nThere will probably be some games in the second half of the schedule in which the Colts' smallish front seven finds the line of scrimmage more terrifying than it did Sunday, and in which its youthful secondary is overmatched. But to those who suggest Indianapolis will never get things right defensively, despite Dungy's insistence to the contrary, and that the Colts will only go as deep in the playoffs as it offense takes it, some grist for the future.\nOf the team's 11 defensive starters on Sunday, 10 are home-grown products. The lone free agent was tackle \n. Left end \n was originally drafted by Philadelphia in the seventh round in 2002, but the Eagles rescinded his rights before ever signing him. Cornerback \n played one season in the CFL before signing with Indianapolis as a free agent in 2000. The other eight starters were all Colts draft picks.\nAnd of the 11 starters, seven have never played for a head coach other than Dungy, which means they were inculcated into his system from the outset of their NFL careers.\nPart of that, of course, is that the Colts can't afford high-priced free agents, because so much of their salary cap is devoted to offensive players. But the element that isn't much mentioned is that Dungy prefers, in his words, to \"grow\" his defense, even if that means some obvious growing pains.\n\"You look around and, for the most part, what you see are our type of guys, players who have come up in this system,\" said June, a former college safety who last season made the switch to linebacker. \"Players who can run, and run, and then run some more.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1919198"},

{"title": "Lack of exposure hurts NFL assistants", "text": "\nSince 1990, and through this week's inevitable events with the \n, there have been 104 head coaching changes in the league. And in the 104 transitions, the new head coaches who had prior NFL experience as a coordinator or high-ranking position assistant outnumber their college counterparts by more than a 9-1 count.\nThe actual numbers, including the elevation of Dolphins defensive coordinator Jim Bates to interim head coach status, are 94-10.\nSo why is it that, even before Dave Wannstedt was out the door at Pro Player Stadium, the name most cited as being at the top of the Miami wish list was Nick Saban of LSU? And why, when there are other NFL head coaching vacancies at season's end, will there be a mad rush to confer prized candidacy status on current college head coaches such as Bob Stoops of Oklahoma, Kirk Ferentz of Iowa, California's Jeff Tedford and, perhaps Urban Meyer of Utah?\nWell, as in most endeavors\n, perception is often confused with reality. And the perception is that outside of the usual suspects -- Romeo Crennel and Charlie Weis of New England, Kansas City's Al Saunders, Jim Johnson and Brad Childress of Philadelphia, and Tampa Bay's Monte Kiffin -- there simply aren't a lot of so-called \"hot\" NFL coordinators attractive enough to merit consideration for head coaching positions.\nPart of the problem is that, at a time when current head coaches and some franchises are severely limiting media access to their staffers, coordinators and even position assistants have been relegated to an unfortunate state of anonymity. Owners read newspapers and the Internet, focus on what assistant coaches are quoted as saying, and make mental post-it notes on those quotes. Such a suggestion, some might say, overstates the importance of the media. But take this to the bank: Assistant coaches love seeing their names in print, because it gets them noticed, and sometimes gets them on short-lists.\nThe other, and likely more significant reason for the focus on college coaches, is that NFL owners are often seeking a fresh face. Then again, as Steve Spurrier demonstrated during his abysmal two-year stint in Washington, a fresh face and revolutionary concepts don't necessarily guarantee success at the professional level. In the wake of the Spurrier mess, the likelihood is that even some NFL owners eyeballing current university coaches for potential openings this winter will think twice about someone from a college campus. And there is an increasing number of college coaches, too, who don't view the NFL in the same light they did a few years ago.\nYou think Pete Carroll is eager to afford the NFL yet a third chance, given his notable accomplishments now at Southern California, and the manner in which he has resurrected his career with the Trojans?\nThe upshot is that, despite the rush to anoint college coaches as big-time favorites to fill NFL vacancies, and the fact many owners don't know enough about football to realize the best candidates are probably right under their noses, most new coaches this offseason will come from current league staffers.\nAll of the assistants mentioned earlier should be worthy candidates. But owners would do well, too, to look beyond the contingent that always seems to land interviews. Jim Mora was hardly a name on everyone's tongue a year ago but, afforded the opportunity to get into the process, certainly proved himself to Atlanta owner Arthur Blank and to general manager Rich McKay. Choosing only the \n guys doesn't ensure that an NFL owner has included all of the \n candidates.\nAt least through his various spokesmen, Huizenga has promised a coaching search of a wide, encompassing and all-inclusive scope. Here's hoping he follows through on that stance, and that his colleagues who figure to soon be considering coaching candidates are in line with that mindset, too.\nHard to say if Dolphins general manager Rick Spielman, who on Wednesday declared that he had direct assurances from Wayne Huizenga that he would return in 2005, was misled by the owner, misunderstood him, or simply assumed he had a job because of his role in helping to identify head coaching candidates. Pick one or all of the those options. Whatever his take on the situation, and the rationale he used to arrive at it, Spielman was certainly put in his place by the broadside fired by team president Eddie Jones on Thursday. In clarifying Spielman's role, Jones, who will retire in March, offered no guarantees that the general manager will be part of the Dolphins' new football regime. Fact is, it's hard to see how Huizenga, who is concerned about growing discontent among his fan base, can somehow reconcile the continued employment of a guy who is every bit as culpable as deposed coach Dave Wannstedt for the franchise's sudden fall from grace. No one, not even his critics, can dispute Spielman's work ethic. He is a dawn-to-dusk grinder, a guy whose long hours are reflective of his background as a scout, a well-intentioned personnel man. But hard work that doesn't translate into bottom-line accomplishments, in the NFL as in virtually every walk of life, means very little. And the bottom line is that Spielman, who hasn't accomplished very much, presided over a mess this year. Truth be told, the Dolphins need to realize that Spielman is probably more a hindrance than a help, if they want to attract high-profile coaching candidates. Do you really believe, for instance, that Nick Saban could be pried out of Baton Rouge, La. if part of the deal was that he had to keep Spielman around as his general manager? Not likely. Most candidates, unless they are so desperate to become a head coach they will accept any conditions of employment, are going to want their own personnel chief on-hand. And on Thursday, after Spielman's ill-time Al (\"I'm in Charge Here\") impersonation of a day earlier, Jones made it pretty clear the new head coach will make such a call. It probably means that Spielman, who many league observers feel was in over his head as general manager, will be gone come 2005.\nAs noted by ever-insightful national NFL writer Paul Domowitch of the Philadelphia Daily News, the anticipated elevation of \n to starting quarterback in Miami for the balance of this season could boost the potential candidacy of Eagles offensive coordinator Brad Childress for the Dolphins head coach job. Childress, who certainly deserves the opportunity to interview for the vacancy, worked with Feeley in Philadelphia, of course. He tutored Feeley well enough to squeeze a 4-1 record out of him as the emergency starter in 2002 when both \n and primary backup \n were injured. So, should Feeley demonstrate in the final two months of the '04 season that he really should be regarded as the Dolphins' starter for the future (remember, owner Wayne Huizenga this summer compared him to Dan Marino, in an obvious bit of hyperbole), it would make sense to consider as a viable head coach possibility the man who helped hone his skills. The feeling here is, too, that Childress is long overdue when it comes to being seriously considered for a head coaching spot.\nSince we don't deal much with the television end of things, we generally prefer to leave analysis of the league's network contracts to those journalists with expertise in that area, or the ones who generally are leaked such information by NFL officials. But on the matter of the proposed Thursday night broadcasts that could become part of the NFL landscape in the not-to-distant future, these thoughts: The league needs to be very careful about not diluting its product by adding Thursday, and perhaps Saturday, to its equation. This isn't the CFL, guys, where they play their games all over the week. Thursday may not, indeed, become the NFL version of \"must see TV,\" because even the hardest core fans can still be over-saturated. And, let's be honest, how many coaches are going to want to compress game preparation into just a couple days, particularly during the late-season chase to the playoffs? One other thought: At first blush, it seems the television accords struck with Fox and CBS fall well shy of the increases that commissioner Paul Tagliabue has so adeptly wrung from the networks in past negotiations. In those deals, The Commish was able to double the rights fees. The deals finished this week represent increases of about 25-30 percent, still pretty lucrative in this environment, but perhaps the first indication that the astonishingly exponential bumps of the past are now history.\nYou've got to give \n assistant general manager Mike Tannenbaum, one of the NFL's savviest and most accomplished salary cap managers, an \"A\" for effort. Over the last several months, the Jets have attempted to strike contract extensions with pending unrestricted free agents like defensive end \n, defensive tackle \n and right offensive tackle \n. And, despite offering guaranteed money of eight figures in most of those cases, Tannenbaum and the Jets have been rebuffed. The thinking in some league quarters is that at least a few of the veterans have spurned the Jets extension offers, and will instead test the free agent waters next spring, because they feel that Bill Parcells, their former coach in New York, will pursue them in Dallas and help enhance their market value. Time will tell whether those rumblings are reality or just rumor. The Jets did, of course, retain their most important player, quarterback \n, with a long-term extension worth $64 million prior to the season. The team, on the other hand, has moved cautiously with defensive end \n, currently the NFL's leading sacker, and another high-profile player eligible for unrestricted free agency after the 2004 campaign. The reason: Abraham experienced some off-field problems last season and management was wary of that.\nOne of the NFL's top defensive minds, and a guy whose exotic blitz schemes always make the \n a difficult opponent for whom to prepare, coordinator Jim Johnson has typically ignored statistics during his long career. For Johnson, the numbers that count the most are the ones on the scoreboard, and so \"points allowed\" has long been his barometer of choice. But coming off the loss at Pittsburgh in which the Eagles allowed a whopping 252 rushing yards, and a four-game stretch in which opponents averaged 172.0 yards on the ground, Johnson could no longer ignore those bloated figures. Thus this week's shuffle at linebacker, with \n elevated to the No. 1 spot in the middle, former middle linebacker \n bumped to the weak-side position, and \n benched. Philadelphia is surrendering an average of 4.7 yards per carry and that is nearly 15 percent higher than the NFL average of 4.1 yards. The Eagles were higher than the league-wide average each of the last two seasons -- the norms were 4.2 yards in both 2002 and 2003, and Philadelphia was at 4.3 yards in the former of those seasons and at 4.5 yards in the latter -- and still advanced to the NFC title game. But in a season when another NFC championship game defeat is unacceptable, everything is under more scrutiny in 2004, and the running woes had to be addressed. We noted when the team made its peace with Trotter and brought him back this summer, after his two years with Washington, that there would come a point in the season where he could be of value to Johnson and head coach Andy Reid. Looks like that time has come.\nFirst impressions aren't always lasting impressions in the NFL but, based on his first regular-season start last Monday, rookie safety \n certainly looked like a player who can make an impact in the \n' young secondary. The former Iowa star and second-round draft choice, who missed all of training camp while rehabilitating a foot injury and because of ponderous contract negotiations, posted five tackles in the victory over the \n. In person, and then again on the television tape, he seemed to be around the line of scrimmage on most running plays and didn't appear to embarrass himself in pass defense. And Sanders, who had an eye-opening workout at the combine in February (including a 40-yard time in the 4.4s), to go along with an excellent college career, also added two special teams tackles. Sanders hardly fits a computer model for the position, at just 5-foot-8, but he was a \n in college and, the bet here is that he will be at the NFL level, too. Some pundits wondered how the Colts could afford to add another undersized safety to a roster that already includes \n (5-10), a second-round pick in the 2003 draft. But when Doss returns from the groin injury from which he is currently rehabilitating, he and Sanders figure to form one of the NFL's smallest, but toughest-hitting safety duos. In fact, add \n, \n and \n to the mix, and the maligned Indianapolis secondary has notable depth at the safety position.\nHe isn't about to make waves now but, ever so quietly, Minnesota tailback \n has suggested to Vikings officials that he might not mind being traded in the offseason. Bennett sees the handwriting on the wall. Although \n is just one misstep away in the NFL substance abuse policy from a one-year suspension, the Vikings love the slashing style of the second-year veteran and he is destined to be the No. 1 back in Minnesota. Rookie \n demonstrated during his month-long stint as the starter, that he is far superior than his fourth-round draft status. That leaves Bennett, who has struggled with maturity and injury issues in the past, as the potential odd-man out. Hard to say what the market might be for Bennett, if the Vikings dangled him in trade talks during the offseason, but there would be some takers. When healthy, Bennett is a Pro Bowl-caliber tailback, a guy with superb \"long speed,\" an attribute hard to find at the NFL level. One possible taker might be Arizona, since Dennis Green is the coach who drafted Bennett in the first round in 2001, and since the Cardinals aren't likely to gamble they can squeeze another productive season from the venerable \n.\nWhile on the subject of the Vikings, there continue to be strong rumblings that owner Red McCombs is still intent on selling the franchise, but that he is adamant about his asking price of about $600 million. McCombs has reduced budgets in virtually every department of the organization and made some maneuvers that figure to keep the club's salary cap costs low in 2005, perhaps to make the Vikes a more attractive purchase for someone like Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor. The thing is, Taylor isn't likely to meet McCombs' asking price. Other potential buyers have come and gone in the past year or so, and McCombs may have to adjust the price tag to renew their interest.\nSo maybe the career of Buffalo quarterback \n isn't salvageable, and \n, the first-round pick still rehabilitating from a broken leg suffered in training camp, will be the Bills starter in 2005. But in the past two weeks, Bledsoe offered a few hints that an old dog can, indeed, master some new tricks. Bledsoe has displayed better footwork, including a \"slide step\" that coordinator Tom Clements and quarterbacks coach Sam Wyche have been teaching him, in that period. The footwork, while a seemingly innocuous element, has helped Bledsoe buy some time in the pocket. He hasn't been sacked and hasn't thrown an interception in those two games.\nPer usual, there were the requisite number of \"chalk\" selections on the various mid-season All Pro teams that media outlets published this week. And in discussing some of them with personnel directors and scouts, as usual, there were a number of oversights. Taking nothing away from Kansas City star \n, but he isn't even the best guard on his team right now, given the first-half performance of \n. Another blocker who deserved more consideration, according to scouts, is Pittsburgh left tackle \n, who is dominating opponents in the running game and has greatly improved his pass protection skills. Denver safety \n, Pittsburgh inside linebacker \n, Eagles cornerback \n, Houston linebacker \n and Colts guard \n were some of the other names mentioned.\nThe NFL Management Council, which essentially oversees all labor matters in addition to other key matters under its purview, has voided the contract extensions signed last week by \n starting defensive end \n and reserve tailback \n. Seems that, because both players signed one-year qualifying offers during the offseason, they were not eligible for extensions. That means, while both players strongly suggested they want to return to the improving Cardinals in 2005, they will be eligible for unrestricted free agency in the spring. The smart money is that both re-sign in Arizona. Then again, Zellner and Hambrick have played exceptionally well in recent weeks, and could elicit better offers from other franchises if they continue their performances.\n In this spot last week, we noted that San Francisco linebacker \n, who is playing impressively filling in for the injured \n, could void his 49ers contract after this season. My bad. The potential void comes after the 2005 campaign. ¬Ö Not surprisingly, quarterback \n is getting more repetitions in \n practices, and coach Tom Coughlin is apt to shorten the leash on which \n is now working.¬Ö Defensive tackle \n will return to the \n lineup on Sunday, after missing three games because of knee and shoulder injuries sustained in a one-car accident on Oct. 17, and no one will be more thrilled to see him than \n. The Falcons' standout defensive end has 7¬Ω sacks in games in which Coleman played, and zero sacks during his absence. ¬Ö Denver coach Mike Shanahan intentionally shot the messenger this week in denying an NFL Network report that he might be interested in the Dolphins coaching vacancy if things go south in Denver over the second half of this season. You can bet that, his public stance aside, Shanahan didn't mind the report nearly as much as he indicated he did. ¬Ö Kudos to 41-year-old offensive lineman \n, who has filled in admirably at right tackle for the \n, despite spending most of his 19-year career at guard. Redskins coach Joe Gibbs praised Brown this week and noted that acquiring the veteran blocker was arguably the best personnel move the club made all year. ¬Ö The \n' 1-7 start is the worst half-season ever for a team coming off a Super Bowl appearance. ¬Ö Word is that the Panthers are close to shutting down injured tailback \n for the rest of the season. ¬Ö In an effort to dictate coverages and defensive fronts, the Indianapolis coaches used tight end/H-back \n more in the slot last Monday night. That alignment forced the Vikings to keep their base defense on the field, and permitted some mismatches in the passing game, with Clark often covered by a linebacker. To create running creases for \n, the coaches then went to wideout \n in the slot. When the Vikings responded with their \"nickel\" package, Indianapolis was successful running the ball against the softer front. Look for more of the same from the Colts, who realize that their offense has to be better balanced to help protect their suspect defensive unit.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1920864"},

No new date has been set.\nDoug Thornton, general manager for the Superdome and New Orleans Arena, said he has received a preliminary draft of one of the studies pertaining to the feasibility and costs associated with either a dome renovation or a new stadium.\nThornton said the study indicates that renovations would cost around $160 million and could be completed in phases so that the Saints, Tulane, the Bayou Classic and annual bowl games would not have to be relocated for a season.\nThornton said the study estimated costs for a new stadium at around $500 million.\nCoulon added that community interest for a new stadium \"has been less than enthusiastic,\" while the hotel industry has vocally opposed a new proposal to combine a new stadium with a convention center expansion.\nAs for Superdome renovations, there has been talk -- but only that so far -- that the Saints would want the grounds around the building spruced up to accommodate tailgate parties better, Coulon said. There are no cost estimates for that yet.\nDome officials said the renovations themselves would likely include adding and reconfiguring premium seats and moving them closer to the field; adding luxury suites; widening certain concourses; adding bathrooms and concession stands; and converting some of the stadium's second-level convention space into trendy lounges with glass walls that will offer a view of the city and provide direct, private access to club-level seating.\nState officials have been awaiting the Saints' proposal anxiously while staying current with periodic reports out of Los Angeles concerning the NFL's plans to re-establish itself there.\nBecause the NFL already has 32 teams, most reports have suggested the league would prefer to move an existing team to Los Angeles rather than creating a 33rd team, which would further dilute talent and cause scheduling complications.\nThe Saints routinely come up as the most likely option because of ongoing stadium concerns and the fact that New Orleans is among the league's smallest markets. Los Angeles would be one of the largest.\n\"I don't think there's any official concern\" about a possible move to Los Angeles, Coulon said. \"We're getting briefed, but more importantly, the focus here is getting our act together and getting an agreement. Tom Benson has said consistently he wants to be here. The governor said she wants the team to remain here.

{"title": "O-line wearing down opposition", "text": "\nPITTSBURGH -- In football, as in virtually every other sport at all levels, it is pretty much the ultimate representation of pending submission.\nYou've seen, no doubt, the tell-tale signs: A player on his knee, sucking for air, maybe grabbing at his shirt, beaten physically and emotionally, ready to send up the white flag.\nAnd so it was here Sunday, during a third-quarter timeout and with all four of the Philadelphia defensive linemen down on one knee and two of three linebackers also in the genuflection stance, that the \n offensive line unit knew that it had run another opponent out of Heinz Field.\nWith heavy emphasis on the \n part of things.\n\"Oh, yeah, we noticed it,\" acknowledged Steelers standout left guard \n when asked about the Eagles' unofficial surrender. \"We were ready for the timeout to be over and I'm sure they were thinking, 'Can't we get another minute or two?' But we didn't want them to be able to catch their breath. Not at all. We wanted to keep pounding the ball at them as much as we could.\"\nWhich is precisely what Steelers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt had in mind as well. Dialed in with the running game, Steelers quarterback \n had to throw just 18 times in a 27-3 victory even more lopsided than the numbers, and he has yet to register more than 25 attempts in any of his six starts. The Steelers have done a magnificent job of insulating Roethlisberger with an inside power running game that has resurfaced as the preferred method of moving the ball here.\nFor that, credit an offensive line quintet that is imposing its will on opponents, carving out cavernous holes for whoever lines up in the tailback spot.\nIt was not, truth be told, a unit highly regarded entering this season. The line was one of the Steelers' most glaring weaknesses in 2003, in part because of injuries that forced line coach Russ Grimm to shuffle bodies all over the place (three-time Pro Bowl guard Faneca had to move to left tackle at one point), but also because the group never really got into the kind of cohesive rhythm required of blockers.\nWhen starting right guard \n suffered a season-ending knee injury in camp, nudging the inexperienced \n into the lineup, it appeared as if this season might be no better than last. But the line, as evidenced by the outcomes of the last two weeks, has played exceedingly well, and its shared confidence is now palpable.\n\"We know coming in now,\" Vincent said, \"exactly what we're going to do. Sometimes, you get into a situation where the coaches \n you they're going to run, and then the game turns a certain way and they abandon (the run). That hasn't happened to us yet in a game this year. A lot of the confidence we have right now is because the coaches are so confident in us. They're calling running plays again and again and again. We love it.\"\nPittsburgh backs, who are finding huge holes in which to maneuver, also have to love a unit that includes left tackle \n, right tackle \n and center \n. Tailback \n, who ran for 149 yards Sunday, noted that he was often 3 or 4 yards upfield before he encountered initial contact.\nIt's an NFL truism that seemingly will never change: Run the ball on offense, stop the run defensively and you will win a lot more games than you lose. In topping undefeated opponents each of the last two weeks, the Steelers have certainly validated the formula.\nPittsburgh out-rushed the \n and the Eagles by a remarkable margin of 473-28, posted a yawning 149-90 advantage in total snaps and had an incredible lead in time of possession of nearly 25 minutes. Little wonder the Steelers outscored the Pats and Eagles by a 61-23 count.\nThrough the first half of the '04 season, the Steelers now have a positive rushing game differential of 79.8 yards per game. Pittsburgh entered Sunday's showdown against the Eagles statistically ranked No. 4 in rushing offense and third in rushing defense. Those standings will probably be enhanced following Sunday's victory.\nWith his team now riding a six-game winning streak, coach Bill Cowher was quick to emphasize on Sunday evening the play of the offensive line. In fact, his praise for the unit came in his opening remarks, and he spent much of his press conference dealing with the importance of the re-energized unit.\nAsked if the Steelers did anything special in game-planning to contain Philadelphia wide receiver \n, who entered the contest with nine touchdown catches, Cowher used the question to get in another plug for his offensive line.\n\"No, it was called run left and run right on offense,\" Cowher said. \"We controlled the clock. That's the best defense. The best thing we had going for us on defense today was our running game.\"\nAnd with apologies to Bettis, the best thing the running game had going for it was a line that continues to knock defenders off the ball.\nAnd to their knees as well.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1918199"},
{"title": "Steelers quiet Owens on field", "text": "\nPITTSBURGH -- In a relatively quiet \n locker room, where the voice of \n provided the only hint of any noise louder than a whisper, the colorful and controversial wide receiver revealed he had phoned \n last week to apologize for his much-documented remarks about the \n middle linebacker.\nPerhaps Owens might have saved a \n for his Eagles teammates as well, following a pretty sorry performance by both him and the offense in general during a 27-3 loss to the \n.\nOwens entered the game with 42 receptions for 697 yards and nine touchdowns. His nine scores represented half of the Eagles' total of 18 for the year. Only in an Oct. 17 victory over Carolina had the verbose playmaker failed to get into the end zone.\nBy any standard, though, Owens' output here Sunday, against a Pittsburgh secondary that never had to resort to the few gimmick coverages coordinator Dick LeBeau implemented for the matchup, was microscopic. One clever fan sported a sign that read, \"T.O. ripped my other sign,\" a clear reference to the fact Owens had shredded a homemade placard during a recent victory.\nOwens, however, hardly tore up the Steelers defense.\nHe finished the afternoon with just seven catches for 53 yards, his longest reception for 20 yards in the third quarter. In fact, a short, third-quarter flurry, in which he had grabs of 13 and 20 yards on successive plays, represented the most noise he made on the field.\nOff the field, Owens, who unofficially had 13 passes thrown to him, appeared at one point in the second half to be in an animated conversation with Eagles quarterback \n. The television cameras showed Owens following McNabb on the sideline, and the popular conclusion was that he was lobbying for the ball. But Owens insisted after the game that he was merely attempting to pump up McNabb, not pump him for more action.\n\"Donovan is obviously a competitor, and I am, too,\" Owens said. \"It's going to be like that sometimes. It's nothing different than when we are at practice. We both try to pick each other up. ... Things just happen.\"\nWhat didn't happen Sunday was Owens having any sort of impact on the game. While the Steelers' early 21-0 lead forced Philadelphia to abandon the run, their passing game was obviously out of sync, and it didn't help that the Pittsburgh defense broke through to sack McNabb four times. With defenders in his face throughout, McNabb reverted to the scattershot passer so often witnessed in past seasons.\nHe completed only 15-of-24 passes for a season-low 109 yards, had one notably horrible interception and posted just three completions of more than 10 yards. To his credit, and despite some politicking by Owens, he didn't try to force the ball to his star wide receiver.\nHad he, Steelers defenders said, it wouldn't have mattered.\n\"We just pretty much played him straight-up, not all man-to-man, but not anything out of the ordinary,\" said cornerback \n, who started a second straight game in place of the injured \n. \"He's a great player and, honestly, we had a couple of special things planned for him.

{"title": "Brees takes advantage of playing time", "text": "\nWell-fortified with all manner of lightning bolt-adorned paraphernalia, the souvenir stand adjacent to the \n practice field at training camp this summer somehow was woefully shy of a popular item, stocking the uniform jerseys of only two players.\nThe first, of course, was the familiar No. 21 of star tailback \n. The other shirt for sale was that of the San Diego starting quarterback.\nOr so the proprietors, and most Chargers officials for that matter, thought at the time.\nTo all the San Diego fans who purchased those No. 17 jerseys with the surname \"Rivers\" emblazoned across the back, well, just be patient. Your day is coming, folks, probably by the commencement of training camp 2005. The \n starter for this year, first-round draft choice \n, will almost certainly be the ascendant starter by then.\nFor those who went hunting futilely for a No. 9 shirt, hey, get in line. The owner of that particular uniform after all, fourth-year veteran \n, was pretty fortunate to find one for himself. Ironically, now that Brees has \n, and improved his game exponentially, it seems, he probably won't need that Chargers jersey much beyond the end of this season.\nIn a season when the slate for comeback player of the year honors could be more bloated than some of Tuesday's referenda-filled local ballots -- \n quarterback \n, tailbacks \n of Denver and Arizona's \n, and Atlanta defensive end \n all merit consideration at this point -- Brees might well be the poster boy for all those veterans who have reclaimed their careers in 2004.\nEight weeks into the campaign, Brees rates third in the NFL in quarterback efficiency, his mark of 106.8 trailing only \n and \n. Over the past five games, four of them Chargers victories, he has completed nearly 75 percent of his passes, thrown for 11 scores and just one interception, and compiled a 122.8 quarterback rating in that white-hot stretch.\nNot bad for a guy who was benched for five games in 2003, replaced in two others, and concluded the season as the NFL's third-lowest rated starter. Nope, not bad indeed, given that, by now, Brees was supposed to be on the bench or on another team's roster.\nThe latter of those scenarios will almost certainly unfold in the offseason, when Brees is an unrestricted free agent, and when economics dictate, as they did with the \n and \n this spring, that San Diego officials hand over the keys to the franchise to the highly-regarded Rivers. Truth be told, had Rivers been in camp on time, he'd probably be tooling around in the driver's seat already.\nInstead, Brees has taken advantage of the situation, and resurrected a career that seemed to be stuck in reverse at the end of the '03 season.\n\"When they drafted Philip, obviously, it's upsetting, it's disappointing,\" acknowledged Brees, a second-round choice from Purdue in the 2001 draft. \"The first thing you want to think about is, 'Well, what does this mean for me?' But I think once I started to do that, I realized, 'Hey, that's out of my control.' So I just started concentrating on the things that I could do for me to be better.\"\nSome of those things: Improved efficiency in the red zone, an area where the Chargers coaches felt in 2003 that his less-than-ideal physical dimensions kept him from seeing the field very well. Better ball security, coming off a year in which he threw 15 interceptions and fumbled five times. Getting into a rhythm and delivering the ball in the framework of the offense without always feeling compelled to make the big play.\nBrees, 25, has done all of that, and more. In so doing, he not only has salvaged his own career, which was still on the precipice of disaster as recently as last month, but also led the usually bumbling Chargers to a tie for the AFC West lead, and muffled rumors that coach Marty Schottenheimer could be in trouble.\nSuddenly this is a pretty good looking young team, a franchise far better girded for the future than it was only about a year ago. \"I get the feeling,\" said Tomlinson, who has been forced to gut his way through games for the past month with a nagging groin injury, \"that suddenly people are looking at us a little different now.\"\nFor that, much of the credit can be attributed to Brees, the quarterback selected by the Chargers in 2001 after they essentially passed on \n, shipping his rights in the lottery to the \n instead. That deal, the wisdom of which will be forever debated, will link Brees to Vick for all time. But with Tomlinson (the player chosen by the Chargers instead of Vick) regarded as one of the NFL's premier runners, and Brees (taken with the top pick in the second round) playing well, the megaswap is no longer viewed through such a harsh prism in San Diego these days.\nAnd, not surprisingly, neither is Brees. Then again, his newfound stature in the San Diego community and with Chargers fans and, yeah, coaches and teammates as well, has been only recently achieved.\nWith the Chargers coming off consecutive losses that dropped their record to 1-2, and hosting the \n, there were strong indications that Brees was on a very short leash in that Oct. 3 contest. Word was that, even a few poor series would earn Brees a speedy hook, and signal the advent of the Philip Rivers Era. Brees has conceded that he suspected his starting job was on the line in that contest.\nHe responded by completing 16 of 20 passes for 206 yards, with three touchdown passes and no interceptions in a 38-17 trouncing of the Titans. That victory commenced not only the Brees hot streak, but also the stretch in which the once mundane San Diego offense has averaged 30.2 points, 42 of them in last Sunday's torching of the despised but dilapidated \n.\nIn that game, Brees experienced a career outing, completing 22 of 25 attempts for 281 yards, five touchdowns and no interceptions. Of his three incompletions, two came on obvious throwaways. Brees termed the performance \"fun,\" but his teammates used far more flattering language to describe it.\n\"That was an awesome performance by him, especially considering he was a guy that a lot of people wrote off,\" noted fullback \n. \"A lot of people in that position would have just conceded and said, 'This is what's going on. I'm not going to get the (starting) job,' and just gone in the tank.\"\nOf course, what Neal left unsaid was that many of those who wanted to nudge Brees into the tank are drawing Chargers paychecks. At various times in the offseason, general manager A.J. Smith acknowledged the need to \"upgrade\" the team's quarterback position. And there were instances in which San Diego listened to trade offers for Brees, ironically, one of them from Atlanta, where he would have served as Vick's caddie.\nBut the Chargers, perhaps prompted in part by Rivers' training camp holdout, held onto to Brees, much like a struggling swimmer clings to a hunk of driftwood, and now he has proven to be the franchise's life preserver.\nThe confidence Brees always exhibited, even in the wake of abysmal performances, is not nearly as feigned now. The quarterback in whom Schottenheimer and the organization manifested such tenuous faith, and who they planned to deep-six, has become the symbol for a team that is no longer on the NFL scrap heap. Backed against the wall, and with the shadow of a $40 million replacement just over his shoulder, Brees has come out firing.\n\"He's taken more personal accountability, held himself up to a lot higher standard, and found out that his abilities were good enough to reach that standard,\" said a Chargers assistant coach after the team's Oct. 17 defeat at Atlanta, the lone loss for the team in its last five games. \"It's kind of trite, but Drew has stayed within himself more and used the people around him instead of trying to do everything himself, and it's made him better. In the bigger picture, too, it's made us better.\"\nLikely to depart the Chargers after this year as a free agent, Brees has positioned himself nicely in the pending unrestricted market. Someone will pay him handsomely, it appears, to try to replicate the resuscitation he has enacted for both himself and the Chargers over the past month. If his time in San Diego is short, so is Brees' vision, and his goal is to take the Chargers to the playoffs for the first time since 1995 and worry about the future when it arrives.\nIf he's earned the right to stick it down the craw of his critics, well, that, too, will wait.\n\"Keeping this going,\" he said, \"is the only priority right now.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&page=/trend/2004week8"},

The former first-round draft choice ('92) was excused from practice last Friday for personal reasons, obviously to consider his future. He did not accompany the team to Dallas for Sunday's game, a fairly unusual move.\nTeam officials had indicated they would meet with Porcher on Monday, but their public stance was that a resolution of his situation was not imminent. Porcher, who spent his entire career with the Lions, apparently felt differently.\n\"We all think we can play forever, and I was no different, but now the time has come to step aside,\" Porcher said. \"These last seven weeks have been tough.

{"title": "Roethlisberger making all the plays", "text": "\nPITTSBURGH -- In the big picture, and in retrospect as well, the play now looks sort of non-descript, especially given the overall dominance and obvious physical advantage the \n demonstrated Sunday afternoon in ending the New England Patriots' 21-game winning streak with a thud.\nBut if you are seeking out a quintessential moment, the snippet that defined the confidence of the Steelers and rookie quarterback \n, well, consider this: Leading 21-3 in the second quarter, after scoring three touchdowns in a 3:33 span of the opening period, the Steelers faced a third-and-one at their own 24-yard line with about 12 minutes left in the half.\nBy that point, Pittsburgh had already established its superiority over the line of scrimmage, and tailback \n already had 47 yards on 11 attempts. So, on the short-yardage play, the Steelers figured to pound Staley into the line again, or to bring on \n to grind out the one yard necessary to move the chains, right? Nope. Pittsburgh aligned in a three-wide receiver/one-back formation with Roethlisberger in the shotgun. \nRoethlisberger took the snap, dropped just one step, and in perfect rhythm rifled a 10-yard completion to wide receiver \n, slanting quickly from the right, just a hair inside of Patriots strong safety \n. First down, Steelers, and the first real tangible evidence that Roethlisberger would not be rattled by the Bill Belichick-designed defensive scheme.\nIronically, the Steelers didn't score on the series, punting instead four snaps later. But a message had been sent by Roethlisberger, perhaps telepathically, to Belichick. \n, Roethlisberger seemed to be saying. OK, so the Steelers' first-round draft pick, who has now rung up a 5-0 record since replacing the injured \n as the starter, doesn't call his own plays. Still, it was notable that Steelers offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt had so much faith in Roethlisberger that he permitted him to throw in what seemed to be a situation that begged for a gimme running call.\n\"I don't think there's much in the playbook that we're holding back on now,\" said Steelers center \n, alluding to the fact Whisenhunt had whittled down the play menu when Roethlisberger first moved into the starting lineup. \"The more he plays, the more you appreciate what (Roethlisberger) is doing, and the more you let him do, too.\"\nIndeed, the former Miami (Ohio) University star, who has now won 18 straight starts dating back to a season-opening loss to Iowa in 2003, sure looks like the real deal. Poised. Unflappable. Accurate. Sharp both mentally and physically.\nAnother example: With 4:52 remaining in the first quarter, Pats stud cornerback \n limped off the field, having aggravated a lingering foot injury on a play on which Roethlisberger had converted a first-and-20 with a 21-yard completion to Ward on a hook route. With Law on the bench, the already shorthanded Patriots had to shuffle their secondary, bringing in undrafted free agent rookie \n to play the one corner spot.\nOn the second play after Gay replaced Law in the lineup, Roethlisberger torched the rookie with an incredibly well-placed 47-yard touchdown pass to \n. Again, the Steelers rookie didn't call the play. But he was aware enough to know that tight end \n had cleared out the middle of the field, that there was no safety help deep, and that Burress had a half-step on the overmatched rookie.\nRoethlisberger's second TD pass to Burress, a four-yard fade, was almost as well-thrown, with the quarterback using the wideout's size advantage over free safety \n, and putting the ball in a spot where only his teammate could catch it. There were some skeptics, yours truly among them, who felt Roethlisberger might suffer at least the occasional meltdown Sunday in playing against a defensive genius like Belichick. But that never happened.\nOnce again, Roethlisberger was in control, and never seemed to blink. The consensus in the NFL before the draft was that Roethlisberger might, in time, be a superior talent to \n and \n. But the key term was \n, since scouts felt his level of competition in college meant he would need more developmental time. But while Manning and Rivers are still waiting for their first NFL starts, Roethlisberger now has five on his r√©sum√© and gets better every week.\nHe passed an acid test Sunday, not only in besting Belichick, but in throwing virtually every pass imaginable and leading his team to a victory that immediately stoked confidence in the Steelers locker room. And much of that confidence, as manifested on the third-and-one call in the second quarter, is clearly a result of the trust the players and coaches have in their callow quarterback.\nThe other rookies\n\nSpeaking of Manning and Rivers, the events of Sunday were crucial for them, since their teams both won. Let's be honest: Had the \n lost a second straight game, and had \n played as poorly in Minnesota as he had in the previous Sunday's home loss to Detroit, it's a pretty good bet coach Tom Coughlin might now have been contemplating the possibility of turning things over to Manning.\nBut after a horrible start -- being sacked twice on the Giants' opening series, after the defense had recovered a fumble deep in Vikings territory, and having to settle for a field goal -- Warner proceeded to play well enough to keep Manning at bay. He played a relatively efficient game, with no turnovers (despite three fumbles), and did a nice enough job directing his team's low-risk game plan, rife with heavy doses of \n.\nBeing 5-2 and with a rebound victory on the r√©sum√©, is a lot better than being 4-3 and riding a two-game losing streak, which is where New York would have been had the Giants and their quarterback faltered on Sunday afternoon. The latter would have sent the Big Apple media masses into a frenzy, for sure, calling for Manning to start. There can be no such suggestion now, though, coming off a victory that ties the Giants for the third-best record in their conference.\nAs for Rivers, well, he seems destined to spend his entire rookie campaign on the bench, particularly after the performance of \n in San Diego's 42-14 rout of the \n. Brees threw five touchdown passes, zero interceptions, and rang up a near-perfect passer rating of 153.1. At 5-3, the Chargers are suddenly tied for first place in the AFC West.\nLooking at its schedule, there is no reason San Diego shouldn't remain in the playoff chase all season, meaning Brees isn't going to the bullpen anytime soon. And that sets up a pretty intriguing scenario. Let's say Brees takes San Diego to the franchise's first playoff berth since 1995. What do you do then if you are Chargers ownership? You certainly didn't invest all that money in Rivers to have him rust away on the bench. Brees is eligible for unrestricted free agency in the spring of 2005, is creating a pretty nice little market for himself, and isn't going to re-sign with the Chargers just to keep the starting job warm for Rivers, right? He certainly isn't going back to San Diego on the cheap. Other franchises already have dropped some not-so-subtle hints they would love to have Brees around. Brees clearly has positioned himself in the catbird's seat and the Chargers probably don't have enough money in the kitty to entice him to stay.\n\nComplete effort by Vick\n\nThat flash of light many people saw emanating from the Rocky Mountains late Sunday afternoon was: (a) Mike Shanahan's head exploding as the \n lost for a second straight week and slid back into a tie for the division lead; (b) the Denver defense, so solid through the first six weeks of the season, being lit up again; (c) the light bulb going on over the head of \n quarterback \n.\nTruth be told, the correct answer is probably \"all of the above,\" but we'll concentrate on only \"c\" for now. In pushing the Falcons to a critical rebound victory, just one week after Atlanta suffered an embarrassing meltdown in a rout at Kansas City, the exciting youngster seemed to finally figure a way to pull together all the scintillating components of his wondrous skill set. Vick ran for 115 yards, the fourth time he has gone over the century mark rushing in his career, trying a league record for 100-yard rushing games by a quarterback in only his fourth season.\nFar more important, though, Vick seemed to play within the parameters and disciplines of the passing design implemented by coordinator Gregg Knapp. He hit 18 of 24 passes for a season-best 252 yards, with two touchdown passes and no interceptions for a passer rating of 136.1. Almost as notable, Vick distributed the ball better than at any time this year, with six completions to tight ends, nine to wide receivers, three to running backs.\nOf note is the nine completions, for 170 yards and two touchdowns, to wideouts. Only once all season had Vick completed more than six passes in a game to his wide receivers. Just twice had he thrown to wide receivers for more than 100 yards. Heck, the Atlanta wide receivers entered the game in Denver with just 36 catches for 515 yards and one touchdown, combined.\nTheir kind public words aside, guys like \n, \n and \n were getting a little antsy about not getting the ball. They had no such concerns Sunday, though, as Vick demonstrated much improved feel for the West Coast derivation Knapp is trying to teach him.\nOn the ground, few teams are going to have an answer for containing Vick, and the Broncos certainly didn't come up with any kind of remedy. But it's when he is clicking in the air that Vick is most dangerous, since most defensive schemes dare him to beat them with his arm. The win at Denver seemed to represent a step forward for Vick but now he has to build on it. About time, too, that Price got the ball into the end zone. In his first 23 games with the team, the Falcons paid Price $11.34 million, and he scored three touchdowns. On Sunday, he scored twice.\nWhat's up in Minnesota?\n\nYou wonder why \n owner Red McCombs would tell \n last week that he planned to pick up the option on coach Mike Tice's contract for 2005, even if the team lost every game the rest of the way, and then back off those comments as soon as they appeared in print? Because of inexplicable games like Sunday, a horrible loss to the Giants, that's why.\nIt was the Giants who began the Vikes' slide in 2003, ending Minnesota's 6-0 start, sending Tice and his club tumbling on a skid that kept them out of the playoffs. And it was the Giants again Sunday, just thoroughly dominating Minnesota, which, with or without \n, has no excuse for such an ugly defeat.\nMcCombs would be ill-advised to not keep Tice around. That said, Tice had better watch himself, because the resurgent Packers, back from the dead courtesy of an unexpected three-game winning streak, are gaining momentum, just as they did a year ago. Tice can't afford to have his team collapse around him again.\nOh, yeah, just a note here: Vikings quarterback \n, after two slow weeks, is no longer on pace to break Dan Marino's league record of 48 touchdown passes in a season. Culpepper's pace is now \"down\" to 46 touchdown passes. On the other hand, \n of Indianapolis is suddenly on pace for 52 touchdown passes. He may need to throw every one of them if the Colts' defense keeps playing the way it has the past couple weeks. Manning and Culpepper face off next Monday night in the RCA Dome.\n\nOwens on the offensive\n\nHow much longer can the 7-0 \n extend their winning streak? Maybe until some opponent takes out wide receiver \n while he's performing one of his silly touchdown celebrations, like Sunday's mockery of Ray Lewis' routine.\nIt was, truth be told, a well-rehearsed imitation. Had he been on \"Dance Fever,\" Owens would have scored high marks. If he keeps it up, though, he's likely to get himself in trouble. And if Owens isn't on the field, it seems, the Eagles could be in trouble. He now has exactly half of Philadelphia's 18 offensive touchdowns. And anyone who thinks that the Eagles offense can succeed without him, well, think again. The unit has scored more than twice in just one of its last four outings. On Sunday, with \n on the bench with cracked ribs, \n led the Philly ground game, with all of 40 yards.\nTake T.O. out of the mix right now and the Eagles might suffer a TKO.\nPunts\n\nThe Colts and Chiefs combined for 1,095 yards in their latest shootout Sunday, the third highest yardage in a game in league history. ¬Ö In a losing cause, Patriots strong safety Rodney Harrison had an amazing 21 tackles on Sunday. And, for whatever reason, the 11-year veteran continues to play on special teams, where he had three tackles. ¬Ö Congratulations to Sen. John Kerry who, based on the outcome of the \n game on Sunday, will now win the presidency. Well, we'll see, actually. The outcome of the Redskins' final home game before the election has been widely cited as a determinant of elections. The 'Skins lost to Green Bay, which historically means that the incumbent will be bounced. ¬Ö The Redskins have yet to score more than 18 points in a game this season. ¬Ö Point of concern: Carolina middle linebacker \n, whose career seems to get stalled by injury every time he gets things going, suffered another concussion on Sunday. He had two similar injuries in 2003 and the Panthers brass has to be concerned about that. ¬Ö The first \n versus \n battle in the NFL went to the \n safety in a forfeit. Detroit rookie wide receiver Roy Williams was sidelined Sunday by a knee injury. Cowboys Pro Bowl safety Roy Williams contributed eight tackles in the Dallas victory. ¬Ö Latest polls show a very close call in the ballot referendum to fund a new Cowboys stadium. ¬Ö Oakland has now lost five straight games, 13 consecutive road outings, and 16 of its last 20 contests. ¬Ö Baltimore quarterback \n went over 200 yards passing for the first time this season.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&page=/morning/week8"},

{"title": "WR coming up big in losing causes", "text": "\n might have figured that losing was a thing of the past.\nAfter experiencing a sub-.500 mark (5-7) as a freshman at Southern Cal, Colbert's collegiate career concluded with three straight winning seasons, including his senior year when the Trojans won a split of the national championship. Nearly four months after his team's Rose Bowl victory, the wide receiver was drafted by the Panthers -- the Super Bowl runners-up.\nNow, all of the past success must seem like a lifetime ago. Colbert, who only experienced three losses in his final two seasons at USC, finds himself in the midst of a five-game skid following the Panthers' 23-17 defeat to Seattle on Sunday.\n\"It's difficult just because of the fact that we're losing,\" said Colbert, who had his second 100-yard receiving game against Seattle. \"It has nothing to do about what they did last year. We're trying to win games and we're not coming out victorious in the end.\"\nAs has been the case with other recent Super Bowl losers (Raiders, Rams, Giants and Falcons), it appears a switch has been flicked on the Panthers (1-6). And perhaps the most significant difference between this season and last year is injuries, the main reason why Colbert has been thrust into the starting lineup.\nThe second-rounder, who was overshadowed by collegiate teammates Kareem Kelly and Mike Williams, figured to be gradually brought into the mix. But when speedster \n went down with a season-ending injury in the opener, Carolina was forced to accelerate Colbert's learning curve.\nIn his first two outings, Colbert put up modest numbers (seven catches, 86 yards). But in a Week 4 loss at Denver, the 6-foot-1 wideout broke out, catching four passes for 115 yards and his second touchdown of the season.\nAnd while Carolina hadn't gotten the good fortune it did a season ago when it won so many nailbiters, Colbert believed the Panthers could overcome a 17-10 deficit heading into the fourth quarter on Sunday.\n\"We were confident because they had been in that position before and failed,\" the receiver told The Seattle Times.\nTwo of Colbert's four catches came in the fourth quarter, including a 63-yarder that set up \n's seven-yard scoring pass to \n. However, the Panthers failed to recover the onside kick and Seattle ran out the clock.\n\"We're working hard during the week. We play to win and it's just not falling our way right now,\" Colbert said. \"We have to keep fighting through and find a way to win.\"\nWith upcoming games against the Raiders, 49ers and Cardinals (a combined 5-17), a win is more likely to come sooner than later.\n:\nThe undrafted LSU alumnus was rudely welcomed into the contest against Pittsburgh on Sunday. Gay, who had just replaced injured veteran \n in the first quarter, got beat for a 47-yard touchdown by \n in what would become New England's first loss in 22 games. In the third quarter, Gay knocked away a pass to \n in the back of the end zone. He finished with four tackles in the contest.\nFor the second time this season, a Fleming touchdown contributed to a Titans victory. The sixth-rounder from Tennessee had two receptions for 50 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown in the third quarter in the win over Cincinnati.\nAnother Panther getting more time than initially projected is the non-drafted free agent from Purdue. Harris, with just two carries through the first seven games, had nine rushes for 45 yards against Seattle. However, he experienced the same misfortune that afforded him the opportunity in the first place -- an injury. He left the game with a shoulder contusion after taking a big hit from Seattle free safety \n. \"It's fine. I just aggravated it a little,\" said Harris, who could see his role limited again if \n returns against the Raiders next weekend.\nKrenzel is now 2-0 against 49ers quarterback \n. Less than two years after beating Dorsey and the Miami Hurricanes for the 2002 national championship, the former Ohio State alumnus won his first start NFL start as the Bears beat San Francisco on Sunday. Krenzel, Chicago's third starting quarterback this season, was 13-of-25 passing for 168 yards with a touchdown and interception. \"As long as Craig functions the way he did Sunday night, you can't help but say, 'Hey, there's some energy there, there's some quarterback playmaking skill there, there's some movement in the pocket there,\" offensive coordinator Terry Shea told the Daily Southtown.\nThe second-rounder from Oklahoma has become a key contributor for the Lions. Lehman, who is second on the team with 43 tackles, had eight against Dallas and has at least seven in each of the last four games.\nThe fifth-rounder from Tennessee continues to establish himself as a playmaker in the secondary. Wilson intercepted \n and returned it 40 yards to set up an eventual touchdown run by \n in the win over Minnesota.

{"title": "Attention to details key to victory", "text": "\nMINNEAPOLIS -- As a conference, the NFC apparently stands for \"Not For Consistency.\"\nExcept for the Eagles, who are unbeaten, each of the nine NFC teams .500 or better have blown critical home games. The Falcons and Giants lost at home to the Lions. The Lions were blown out by the Packers. The Packers lost their first three home games. The Seahawks blew a 17-point fourth-quarter lead to the Rams.\nLike basketball, the key for playoff survival is being able to rebound from embarrassment. The Giants did that Sunday. They bounced back from a poorly played loss at home to Detroit and destroyed the Vikings 34-13.\n\"Coach [Tom] Coughlin told us a great story Saturday night,\" Giants tight end \n said. \"He talked about pain and the core. He talked about how you have to do anything for your teammates. I saw a lot of that from my teammates today. Everybody did the extra [thing] today. On defense, one guy would hold up a ballcarrier so another guy can come in there to make a hit. Everybody is starting to get the picture. If you prepare hard, it pays off.\"\nComing off a bye week, the Giants may have thought they were above preparing. They were 4-1 at the time and apparently full of themselves. Coughlin is anal about preparation. For whatever crazy reason, they tuned him out and Coughlin sensed it during the week. Linebacker \n was late and temporally lost his starting job. The Lions whipped them 28-13.\nThat loss was apparently an attention-getter. Coughlin built off that loss by having a great week of preparation. \"Hustle.\" \"Be smart.\" \"Never stop until you hear the whistle.\" The players heard those overused motivational words for years, but the loss to the Lions allowed it to sink in. In defeat, the Giants gained character.\n\"The persona of this team is that we don't play great all the time, but we always get back up and keep playing hard,\" halfback \n said. \"You don't want to say a loss can be good for a team, but maybe that's what happened.\"\nCoughlin wrote the textbook for bouncing back from a bad home loss. Four plays into the game, Coughlin's attention to detail paid off. Vikings quarterback \n tried one of his patented \"bubble\" screens. Halfback \n floated to his right for a quick screen behind the line of scrimmage. Culpepper took a quick couple steps and fired a pass. Moore let it slip through his hands, but only linebacker \n, drilled all week on those bubble screens, knew the ball was still alive since it was technically a lateral and a fumble.\nLewis picked up the ball and ran it to the Vikings' 22-yard line, setting up a 50-yard field goal by \n and a 3-0 lead less than two minutes into the game.\n\"Only Kevin Lewis knew it was a (live) ball because I sure didn't,\" defensive end \n said. \"I was walking away and he was running the ball. It was heads-up and a great way to start the game.\"\nVikings coach Mike Tice fired his red hanky to challenge the play, but it only wasted a timeout.\nThe Giants didn't stop there. After a Vikings three-and-out, \n sent Shockey along the sidelines against safety \n. In this one-on-one matchup, Shockey has a 50-pound advantage, so Chavous ended up grabbing him and getting a 38-yard interference penalty down to Minnesota's 22.\nHere's another example of improved preparation. The red zone has been the Giants' enemy all season. In six games, the Giants had seven touchdowns in 21 trips inside opponents' 20, worst in the NFC. The team was terrible on short yardage, so bad that Giants fans last week booed ineffective halfback \n when he ran onto the field for short-yardage plays. The Giants don't have the personnel to bunch three tight ends into a short-yardage play and let Dayne try to hit a hole behind a fullback.\nCoughlin self-scouted his team and came up with a different formula. He kept his regular offensive personnel on the field in the red zone. Regular personnel often meant two receivers (\n and \n) and two tight ends (Shockey and \n). The result was four short touchdown runs -- two each by Barber and \n. Dayne didn't even get dressed.\n\"We were just staying in regular personnel, not bunching everybody up and we just ran our best plays,\" Barber said. \"I hope we keep doing that. It proved effective. We had no heavy package (with a sixth offensive lineman). We had no three tight ends. We just left our best players on the field in regular situations.\"\nOne of the Giants' best players is Shockey, who seems to be shaking off the rust from an idle preseason while he recovered from foot surgery. Coughlin flanked Shockey into a split end position and let Warner make play calls at the line based on how the Vikings covered him.\nThe strategy was simple. If the Vikings left him in single coverage by committing an extra safety to stop Barber, Warner would audible to a pass for Shockey. If the Vikings slid a safety or corner to Shockey's side in zone coverage, he'd audible for a Barber handoff on a draw play.\nBarber's second touchdown was a 5-yard draw with the Vikings committing two defenders to Shockey in a zone. With 13:20 left in the second quarter, the Giants cruised to a 17-0 lead, and Vikings fans started filtering out of the Metrodome after a 20-0 halftime deficit.\n\"As a team, we were not going to lay down,\" cornerback \n said. \"People were counting us out after last week. But it's going to be as tough as you make it. The preparation last week was the key. We prepared like we never prepared before.\"\nThe Giants' defense was ready for anything the Vikings wanted to try. Defensive coordinator Tim Lewis came up with a copy of what the Eagles did to defend Culpepper. Defensive end \n played several novel positions. He'd sometimes line up at middle linebacker against three-receiver sets and blitz. He'd move from middle linebacker to either side at defensive end. It kept the blocking schemes a little off-balance and gave the defense options in case Culpepper ran out of the pocket.\n\"Like I said earlier in the week, these guys are the best offense in the league,\" Strahan said. \"For those guys to put up 300 yards, that's a half for them. We kept them under 300 yards today (actually they had 324 yards). Daunte's had three games of five touchdowns or more. You just don't want to be the team that has that happen to you. Our defensive backfield and linebackers played great today.\"\nCulpepper completed 24-of-42 passes for 231 yards and one touchdown. The Giants shut out the Vikings until the nine-minute mark of the fourth quarter. All day, the offense didn't get into a rhythm.\nWith that victory, the Giants rebounded to 5-2 and could be considered the best NFC team that isn't the Eagles. They won in Dallas, Green Bay and Minneapolis. Barber got his usual 100-plus rushing yards and will now get more carries in the red zone. Shockey is getting into a rhythm for the first time this year.\nHe caught three passes for 60 yards, but he needs to get more action. In the third quarter, Warner hit him in the open on a third-and-23. Shockey avoided safety \n and dove to the end zone. His legs hit out of bounds at the 1 before he lunged the ball on top of the pylon. Frustrated, he ripped the pylon out because he didn't score a touchdown.\n\"I get very emotional out there,\" Shockey said. \"I'm not the player I was a couple of years ago. I would have scored on that play a couple of years ago.\n\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1913533"},
{"title": "League not expected to act immediately", "text": "\nThe long-awaited missive from erstwhile tailback \n, officially seeking reinstatement to the league, arrived Monday at NFL offices.\nBut no one, not even Williams and his attorneys, expects the NFL to act on the request anytime soon.\nIn fact, league sources said that Williams has all but abandoned any hope of playing again in 2004, a pursuit that likely would have been futile anyway because of his repeat violations of the NFL substance abuse policy. Instead, those sources explained, attorney David Cornwell, who represents Williams and once worked for the NFL, will attempt to negotiate terms of the player's return for the 2005 season.\nWilliams abruptly retired in July just days before the start of the \n' training camp. His representatives met with league officials on Oct. 21 in Santa Monica, Calif., to clarify his status and explore potential scenarios for his return.\nLeague officials said last week, at an owners meeting in Detroit, that they had yet to receive a formal request for reinstatement. \"When something shows up, we'll deal with it,\" one NFL official said.\nEven with the letter's arrival Monday, though, there will be no hurry to resolve Williams' future. It likely will take some time for Cornwell to broker an agreement under which the talented but enigmatic running back resumes his football career.\nGene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Association, told ESPN.com last week that he supported Williams' return but that it would not occur in 2004. Upshaw also said that Williams erred this spring in not accepting a \"pretty good deal\" that would have gotten him out of the substance abuse program.\nThe terms of that deal would have required Williams to pay a fine of $650,000, the sanction for his first two positive tests. Doing that would have earned him a clean slate. It is believed Williams failed a third test shortly thereafter.\nUnder terms of the substance abuse program, Williams, who by his own admission tested positive for marijuana on three different occasions, would have been suspended for a year had he attempted to un-retire in 2004. Any player who leaves the league while in the drug program, and returns within a year of his retirement, is deemed to have tested positive. A fourth positive test, which would have been the case for Williams, results in a suspension of one year.\nSo it appears the plan now is for Williams to sit out in 2004 -- and possibly, in a good-faith move, submit to league-administered testing in an effort to reinforce his intent to remain clean -- then play again next season. \n he would play is open to question, as Miami players have made it clear they do not want him back and Williams isn't apt to mend those fences.\nDolphins officials have said privately, though, that they regard Williams as a valuable commodity for trade purposes.\n\"We want to get something for the guy,\" one said.\nThe team also wants the $8.6 million it was awarded by an arbitrator, who ruled that Williams breached his contract and that certain default language in the deal was valid. Last week, the Dolphins filed suit seeking payment of the $8.6 million.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1914446"},

His reputation as an inept signal caller is a lot like that rumor about a certain cheerleader at your high school, repeated enough to where it's held as truth.\nTruth is, we don't know what Boller is. We've seen too little of him -- one season -- to evaluate him.\nThat doesn't seem to serve as much of a deterrent, though.\n\"People can say what they want to say,\" Boller said. \"What were they saying about Steve Young when he was a quarterback? What were they saying about tons of different guys? At this position, you have to have thick skin. I'm not worried about the criticism. People are going to always criticize you. I'm just going to go out there and play my (butt) off, and as long as my teammates are behind me and I'm working hard to get better, everything will take care of itself.\"\nTaking care of the football, not taking games over, is Boller's primary responsibility for the Ravens. In that regard, he finds himself in a unique situation. He's learning to drive using the Benz, so to speak, but he's restricted to the parking lot.\nContrast his first full season as a starter to those of a few young quarterbacks who are growing up this year:\nSan Diego's \n threw 526 passes in 2002, his first season as a starter, an average of almost 33 attempts per game. When he wasn't going down 76 times, Houston's \n got off close to 28 throws a game in '02. \n of Detroit averaged more than 35 attempts his first 16 starts. \n, even before the Jaguars really started to turn him loose, slung it just about 30 times a game through his 16th start, which came in Week 3 this season. Each had \"throwaway seasons,\" in other words, years in which their teams had no playoff expectations and were often playing from behind.\nBaltimore's different. Boller is right around 24 attempts a game -- just about where the Ravens want him -- because they expect to be playing in late January.\nThis may come as some surprise, but Baltimore isn't a passing team. For some reason, like the fact that the Ravens have done it, they believe they can achieve their Super Bowl aspirations with an underachieving passing game that most of the time is nothing but an extension of the running game. They're fine with having the league's worst passing game. Coach Brian Billick would rather concede a third down, punt, and put his defense on the field than put Boller in a position to make a critical mistake. Running Jamal Lewis and playing Raven defense gives them their best chance to win, Billick believes. It almost won Sunday's game.\nThe drawback of Baltimore's ball-control philosophy is that it limits Boller's dropbacks. When Baltimore gets a lead, Boller can pretty much forget about padding his passing statistics. He's in handoff mode from there on in. His 38 attempts Sunday marked just the third time that he has thrown 30 times in a game.\n\"When we gave him the opportunity to do it, we came away satisfied with the results,\" Ravens general manager Ozzie Newsome said Monday.\nBut because he's been programmed to play it safe and get the ball out quickly, he doesn't get as much experience reading coverages and seeing routes develop down field as some other young quarterbacks, so his development as a passer has been somewhat retarded. The Ravens aren't about to let Boller go through his growing pains at the possible expense of another Lombardi Trophy. He isn't allowed to make the mistakes from which quarterbacks learn.\n\"A running back runs 30 times, he's got that rhythm by his 30th run,\" Boller said. \"It's maybe a little bit harder for a quarterback to get in a rhythm when you're not throwing as much, but that's not the way it is with this offense. When I do throw it, I've just got to be efficient and make sure I keep the ball so we can stay on the field longer and maybe throw more.\n\"Just the way this offense is built, you're not going to throw the ball 40 times a game when you have a great running back and offensive line. You've got to be efficient and make smart decisions.\"\nThe Ravens decided in the offseason to do something major to upgrade the passing game. We all know how that turned out. Among the many things that stood out in Sunday's reunion was this: If \n can make an already elite quarterback, \n, better, he could have done wonders for Boller.\nOther than Heap, who may return this week from an ankle injury, Boller doesn't have -- no disrespect -- a receiver the caliber of an \n or a \n, one who can bail him out when his throws aren't perfect. Phenom \n, who is in the 20-25 passes a game range, has \n and \n making plays for him. Maybe one of them comes down with Boller's throw that \n couldn't hold onto on Baltimore's last play against the Eagles. Boller doesn't have someone who can turn a short throw into a 24-yard gain or a game-winning touchdown the way Owens can. Excuses? No. Facts.\nBoller does have the goods physically. His 52-yard rope to \n in the fourth quarter Sunday was proof of that. The Ravens like that Boller has improved his mechanics, not overextending as much and letting his passes take off on him. His pocket awareness clearly has improved. His feet aren't as \"happy\" as they used to be. He showed great poise against Philadelphia. He's learning to make sound decisions because he has to. Bringing in Jim Fassel as an offensive consultant seems to have helped.\nIt's like this: The list is long of quarterbacks who struggled early in their careers. So maybe, just maybe, Boller isn't the total liability he's perceived/portrayed to be. Granted he's still a long way -- a very long way -- from good. But he isn't completely lost anymore.\nHe begins his \"second season\" Sunday night against Cleveland.\n\"I'm in games now where it's like playoff games, a playoff atmosphere,\" Boller said. \"A lot of young guys get in there and can suck and lose and it's no big deal because that's what they expect. But when you're in Baltimore, they expect to win. Being a young quarterback in here, I'm learning just like those guys are, just kind of at a different pace.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=smith_michael&id=1914487"},

{"title": "Players hoping to cash in off big seasons", "text": "\nContract years are important. With teams having more cap room than ever, general mangers do their best to get contract extensions done to prevent top players from hitting the free agent market. But negotiations involve two parties, and some players can reap big rewards by playing out the final years of their contract and hitting the open market. Franchise players such as \n, \n, \n and \n aren't included in this list because those players tend to get re-franchised if they don't get deals.\nHere are the players who are doing their best to turn their contract years into big-money deals:\n\n\n No one can figure out why the Seahawks haven't re-signed him but talks have been dead since the summer when they were lukewarm at best. He's the leader of the offense and he's been to the Pro Bowl. His numbers haven't been as good this year because of dropped passes and a bad game against the \n, but Hasselbeck usually plays his best in November and December. Hasselbeck's big money push was made during the 2003 season when he put his name among the elite NFC quarterbacks.\n The former Purdue star turned adversity into potential profit. Decisiveness in his passing decisions has turned him from a 59.4 career thrower with a 73.7 quarterback rating to the league's third-rated passer, 106.8 with a 67 percent completion rate. The Chargers only can keep him around as a backup next year, so he'll hit a tight market in which more than 25 teams have their quarterbacks set for next year. Still, Brees, who will be 26 in January, will be attractive enough to knock someone out of a job.\n Burress is probably playing too good for his own financial good. His size and speed have made him the big-play option for rookie quarterback \n. Unfortunately, he doesn't get many opportunities in games. He's averaging only three catches a contest, but he's getting 20 yards per catch. The Steelers can't afford to let him go and might have to franchise him, which could mean a long holdout. With \n, Burress and \n, Roethlisberger can't afford to let Burress slip away from him to break up this trio.\n For two years, it's bounced back and forth between Abraham and \n over which player gets the contract extension. Ellis was the closest before the season but talks broke off. Now, Abraham is the hot player and both remain undersigned, a potential problem for after the season. Abraham has 8¬Ω sacks. If you watched how the Dolphins moved the ball the six plays he was off the field Monday night, you can see how he's raised his value this season.\n\n\n Owner Jim Irsay says he will do everything possible to re-sign him, but two things hold up the process. First, \n is the priority but the Colts can't do anything with Harrison until they find out about the financial aspects of a collective bargaining extension. Second, the cap is tight so it's going to be tough. The natural move is for James to go to the Dolphins once they find a trading partner after the season for the troubled \n.\n He's been the anchor of a defensive line that leads the league in sacks by linemen (19). Most of the time, he's unblockable. He came into the league with a bad ankle but he's put those worries behind. At the age of 25, Rogers is having a promising young defense being built around him, but he'd be the anchor of any other defense. The Lions need to franchise him if they can't re-sign him before the end of the season.\n Simon has anchored the Eagles 4-3 defense for five years, and he's showing more vocal leadership this season. The Eagles usually let veterans leave through free agency once they get to the age of 30, but Simon is a different problem for the Eagles. He's 26 and just hitting his prime. He's got the ability to get 7-9 sacks a season and has the ability to dominate games.\n After cracking the 1,400-yard plateau last year, Alexander is on pace for a 1,600-yard season, which could make him one of the marquee players in free agency. The Seahawks have the toughest offseason with so many starters whose contracts expire and the franchise tag being given annually to left tackle Walter Jones. With so many starters to sign, the Seahawks might not have enough time to keep Alexander.\n\n\n The Bengals halfback may have \n behind him, but he's a rare commodity. He'll be a 25-year-old free agent halfback coming off a 1,000-yard season. The last time a back coming off a 1,000-yard season moved in the open free agent market was when Leonard Russell went from New England to Denver in 1994. Johnson is on pace for a 1,388-yard season, so it would be crazy of the Bengals to let him go. Running backs hit their prime between the ages of 26 and 29, and Johnson is just heading into his prime.\n Lucas had confidence problems in 2003, but he beat out \n in camp this year and hasn't looked back. It's a pretty good battle between Lucas and \n of the Redskins over who will be the hottest cornerback not getting a franchise tag. Cornerbacks were the hottest commodities in free agency this year, and Lucas and Smoot will be atop most free agent boards heading into the winter.", "url": "http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1915243"},

He announced no\n\ntime frame but hopes to make the hire quickly.\n\"They're going to need a Ph.D. in coaching,\" Turner said.\n\n\"They need to be people of the highest integrity, with flawless\n\ncharacter, who understand the mission of the university and the\n\nbreadth of the job.\"\nTurner, hired in August, and new university president Mark\n\nEmmert are distancing Washington from the turmoil that surrounded\n\nNeuheisel's dismissal. They intend to make the Huskies a national\n\npower again.\nGilbertson, 56, is 7-13 in two seasons after stepping\n\ninto a difficult situation in summer 2003. Neuheisel had\n\njust been fired for gambling on NCAA basketball when Gilbertson,\n\nthe offensive coordinator, was promoted.\n\"It would have been easy to say no,\" Gilbertson said. \"I had\n\nother options, but that would have been the opposite of what we\n\ntell our kids to do: Step up and take a shot.\"\nThe Huskies went 6-6 in Gilbertson's first season, then fell to\n\n1-7 and 0-5 in the Pac-10 after a 31-6 loss at Oregon last weekend.\n\nIt's the worst season in 35 years for a school that shared the 1991\n\nnational title.\nGilbertson, who also coached Idaho (1986-88) and California\n\n(1992-95), is 55-48 overall in nine seasons as a head coach.\nIn his three months on campus, Turner has outlined plans for an\n\nambitious renovation of Husky Stadium, and he wants a winner on the\n\nfield.

Gilbertson was the offensive coordinator, the same job he\n\nheld when the Huskies shared the 1991 national championship with\n\nMiami.\nTurner's goals will require a financial commitment from\n\nboosters, alums and fans.\n\"I'm going to ask our supporters, the people who love the\n\nUniversity of Washington, to step up,\" Turner said.\nHow much will it cost? Well, earlier this year LSU coach Nick\n\nSaban became the highest-paid coach in college football when he\n\nsigned a seven-year, $18.45 million contract.\nTurner said he's more focused on finding the right coach for the\n\njob, but he expressed confidence the school can find a way to pay\n\nenough money to make the best hire.\n\"The profile will have to fit our league,\" he said. \"They've\n\ngot to be able to recruit in the West, particularly in the\n\nNorthwest, put some pizazz in and give people confidence and\n\nhope.\"\nAs for Gilbertson's future, he will work the final three games,\n\nstarting Saturday against Arizona.

They entertain onlookers with their heated battles of who can toss a toilet seat more accurately.\n\"I'm the William Wallace of this game,\" Nick Devito, another member of the Stamford Seven, says.\nThe truth is these guys could be any fans in any Meadowlands lot. This place, with its 25,000 parking spots, is a tailgating mecca. It has its own smell -- burning lighter fluid. It's own sound -- the constant hum of generators. And it's own feel -- that of a cold can of beer pressing against an already frozen hand.\nIn Lot A14, there are the Jetnuts, a group of GM employees from Port Reading, New Jersey, who souped up their full-size 1986 school bus to include everything from the latest BOSE music system to a 6-foot cooler, fully stocked bar and oven. They have a separate trailer that includes a steam table, a hot plate, a jumbo grill and a pair of deep fryers.\nIn Lot B18, there's third-grade special education teacher Rick McGovern, who's been hosting 20 friends in and around his old-school Jets camper for 16 years. In Lot H5, there's Jon Young and his 1972 New York Jets painted hearse/ambulance combo.\nAnd then, in B8, there's the crew from Stamford, which has been coming to games together for almost 20 years, the last five driving a 14-year-old \"short bus.\"\n\"The handicapped elevator is key,\" says Nick Devito, another member of the group, \"That's how we unload the beer.\"\nBut if the Jets have their way, all the pre- and post-game fun could come to an end in 2009. That's when it hopes to open the New York Sports and Convention Center, a state-of-the-art entertainment complex complete that would serve as an indoor/outdoor sports complex as well as a convention center.\nThe facility would give the Jets their first true home. After sharing the Polo Grounds with the baseball Giants and Shea Stadium with the Mets, the Jets moved to New Jersey in 1984 where they share their football stadium with their archrivals, the Giants.\nIt was a strange sight Monday afternoon, seeing Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi rummaging through the trunk of his car looking for a pair of golf clubs while Jets fans tailgated a couple of hundred yards away. It was even stranger looking at a game ticket, which actually read, \"Jets vs. Dolphins, Giants Stadium.\"\nA newly proposed stadium on Manhattan's West Side would give the Jets a home, but it also would eliminate almost all parking, instead relying on public transportation to bring fans to games. That, in turn, would lead to the death of Jets tailgating. Even the team's media guide admits, \"part of the transition to a new stadium that we can call our own will be a shift from the traditional forms of tailgating to new types of pre-game activities.\"\nHow serious are the Jets? A \"stadium\" link on the team website doesn't even mention the Meadowlands, instead going straight to the design for the NYSCC.\nMost fans don't want to hear it.\n\"Without this, why bother?\" Bancroft, the toilet seat-tossing champion, says. \"I mean, win or lose, good times and bad, this atmosphere out here never changes. It's the one constant. There's nothing like this anywhere else in football. And now they want to take that away?\"\nPre- and post-game parking-lot revelry are the lifeblood of Jets football. On Monday, cars started showing up at noon, some 9 hours before kickoff. Once the sun set, one family draped the inside of a box truck with white Christmas lights and used the glare to illuminate a makeshift living room in the middle of the parking lot.\nNearby, Jimmy Buffet's \"Margaritaville\" blared out of a Ryder truck. A disco ball reflected off a pop-up tent. And pickup football games took place at just about every turn. Those who didn't have a tailgate wandered through the assorted parties, arms wrapped around cases of beer as if they were Curtis Martin trying to hold on to the football.\nThe crew from Stamford is a prime destination. On their bus, there are but two rules. No. 1: Never let the Jets ruin a good day. No. 2: No women. One of the guys, a man they call \"Tony Two Quarters,\" wears a pink Jets ski cap. \"Two Quarters\" got his nickname from his inability to last more than two quarters without getting thrown out of the stadium. \"Ahhh, they caught me smoking in the bathroom,\" he said. \"So the guys get on me about it.\"\nThese aren't wild twenty-somethings looking to sow their college oats.

The way it looks, we're going to need some young guys to do that for us.\"\nOn Wednesday, coach Bill Belichick confirmed that Law will not play against the Rams, and a representative for the Pro\n\nBowl cornerback said he'll miss four to six weeks with a broken\n\nbone in his left foot.\nOn top of that, his cornerback partner, \n, said Wednesday he would also be out against St.\n\nLouis, even though his injured knee\n\nis healing faster than expected.\nLaw at first thought he had a sprain, but X-rays at the stadium\n\nshowed a break. The break was confirmed by team doctors when the\n\nteam returned to Foxboro on Monday. Law wore a removable cast and\n\nused crutches after the game.\nKevin Poston, the brother and business partner of Law's agent,\n\nCarl Poston, told The Associated Press that a team doctor diagnosed\n\nthe injury, but Law will seek a second opinion for the broken bone\n\nacross the top of his foot.\nThe injuries to Law and Poole, who has missed three of the last\n\nfour games, leave the Patriots scrambling.\nSecond-year cornerback \n, more accustomed to working as the nickel defender, is expected to get his third straight start, but\n\nBelichick hasn't decided what to do about the other cornerback slot. He could\n\nmove \n from safety and rotate rookies \n and \n into the vacant safety slot, or play Gay as the other\n\ncornerback and keep the starting safety combination of Wilson and Harrison intact.\n\"I's not about one player. It's about a group of players,\"\n\nsaid Belichick. \"There are a number of options, and we'll try and\n\nuse the one we think is best.\"\nAgainst Pittsburgh, Samuel started and Gay, an undrafted free agent out of LSU, took Law's spot when he limped off the Heinz Field surface in the first quarter. Eventually, Gay was chased off the field and Wilson, a cornerback in college, moved outside.\nWhile the Steelers receivers weren't gloating in the aftermath of the victory, they allowed that all the shuffling New England was forced to do because of injuries in the secondary was a significant factor in the contest. Things were so bad at one point that, had the Pats lost another corner, wide receiver \n would have been pressed into action on defense, at a position he hasn't played in a dozen years -- aside from the preseason.\n\"You don't think we knew it when [Law] limped off?\" said \n, who beat Gay for one touchdown and Wilson for another, in the first quarter. \"I don't care who you are, or how deep you are, you don't want to be without your All-Pro [cornerback].\"\nSuffice it to say, one New England staffer acknowledged, there is a lot of juggling going on as the coaches plot out various contingencies.\nAlthough the epidemic of injuries in the secondary is the primary focus of the defensive coaches, their offensive counterparts will also spend the week preparing backup plans. The Pats finished the game at Pittsburgh minus both starting offensive tackles and with quarterback \n under a fierce assault.\nRight tackle \n missed the game with a bad back and left tackle \n, who had an uncharacteristically poor performance working against Steelers weak-side linebacker \n, exited in the third quarter with an undisclosed injury. That left the inexperienced \n, who opened at right tackle in the first regular-season start of his career, playing at left tackle.

{"title": "Springs utilized in creative ways", "text": "\nTo inventory his career interceptions, cornerback \n needs both hands, and then some. But the eight-year veteran has never needed so much as two \n to count the number of sacks on his NFL r√©sum√©.\nUntil, that is, this season.\nIn his first year with the \n, with whom he signed as an unrestricted free agent this spring following seven seasons with the \n, the dogged Springs has added a new element to his repertoire. Once noted for batting down passes, Springs is now \n down quarterbacks before they can get rid of the ball, and his three sacks equal his three interceptions through seven games.\n\"It's exciting, another angle, another way to make use of my skills,\" said Springs, who had just 1¬Ω career sacks entering the 2004 campaign. \"I've always prided myself on being an aggressive player and with what they're letting me do here, just turning me loose on people, it plays right into that mentality. It's cool, (rushing) off the corner, and watching the quarterback's eyes when he first sees me coming.\"\nSprings, 29, is certainly coming on strong this season, and seems to have reclaimed his once-sparkling career nearly undone by injuries. On the league's top-rated defense, a unit where creative coordinator Gregg Williams has elicited stellar performances from a lot of lesser-profile players (and with \n out of the lineup), Springs has arguably been the most pleasant surprise.\nThe third player selected overall in the 1997 draft, and a two-time Pro Bowl defender, his stock had fallen in recent seasons amid a spate of nagging injuries. The former Ohio State standout, once regarded as the model for a \"shutdown\" cornerback, missed an average of nearly three games per season in his seven-year Seattle tenure. While hamstring woes were a major problem, Springs also missed time with a broken thumb, and shoulder and calf injuries.\nThe blunt truth is, in many NFL circles, Springs was viewed as used-up, and perhaps a player who had lost some passion for the game. Fortunately for him and for the 'Skins, Williams didn't see him through that prism, and has schemed up ways to enhance Springs' playmaking skills. Washington invested a $10 million signing bonus on its assessment Springs could be a productive reclamation project and he is certainly paying big dividends now.\nAmong some of the other players who have reclaimed their careers this season:\n Hey, the guy hadn't won a game in nearly three years, so what he's doing in his first season with the Giants is remarkable. Warner still holds the ball too long, and takes too many sacks, but he isn't giving away games and, for coach Tom Coughlin, that is key. His contract all but precludes Warner returning to the Giants in 2005 but, like \n, he is creating a free agency market for himself.\n He already has more yards than the Pats' leading rusher of a year ago, \n, posted in an entire season. More important, the onetime \n malcontent, who had long ago worn out his welcome with his original team, has been a solid citizen in the locker room. For once, Dillon seems to have bought into the team concept.\nDefensive end \n (Cleveland):\n Shunted aside by the \n after notching only 2¬Ω sacks in 14 starts in 2003, the six-year veteran has proven to be a real steal at the left end spot. Ekuban, who registered a paltry 3¬Ω sacks from 2001-2003, already has four this season, to go along with 23 tackles.\n OK, so it's tough to reclaim a career that already has you headed to the Hall of Fame. But the NFL's career rushing leader, with 523 yards on 132 carries, already has doubled his rushing output from a year ago. Smith has a pair of 100-yard games and is averaging 4.0 yards per attempt, his best since the 2000 campaign.\n The Cowboys still can't run the football consistently, as evidenced by their No. 23 statistical ranking, but don't blame it on Allen, a potential Hall of Fame member. After spending last season in coach Bill Parcells' doghouse, the 11-year veteran has moved back to the penthouse level among NFL power blockers and is a sure bet for another Pro Bowl trip.\n Had turned into sort of a journeyman, bouncing around the past few seasons, but has found a home in coordinator Wade Phillips' 3-4 scheme. The seven-year veteran has a career-high 4¬Ω sacks and his one interception equals Foley's previous career total.\n Signed last season as a free agent, he didn't get nearly as many pass rush opportunities as he (or anyone else) felt he would. But the Texans moved him to the right side this year, where he plays more in space, and he has prospered. Not only has he rushed the passer with solid consistency, but Wong has played surprisingly well in coverage, too.\n It might be a little premature to put him in this category but, off the early returns, he has a chance to become a productive starter again under the tutelage of coach Jon Gruden. Let's not forget, it was only three seasons ago that Griese was a Pro Bowl-caliber player in Denver.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1915282"},

Cowher met with both quarterbacks and apprised them of his decision.\n\"I think they both understand and we are ready to move on,\" Cowher said.\nMaddox, who suffered a torn ligament in his right elbow in the second game of the year, at Baltimore, has been increasing his workload in recent weeks and likely will practice full-scale this week.

That all changed, of course, with the Maddox injury.\nRoethlisberger has demonstrated great aplomb in winning five straight games but will face another daunting challenge Sunday against an Eagles defense that typically has a very high blitz ratio. But even Maddox acknowledged that the rookie has the kind of rare poise to handle almost every challenge.\n\"He's played well,\" Maddox said. \"He's making plays. And he's turning broken plays into great plays.\"\nWith a quarterback rating of 104.7, Roethlisberger ranks fourth in the league. Even more remarkable is that he leads the NFL in fourth-quarter passer rating (126.5) and is third in the league in third-down efficiency (112.1). Over the last four games, Roethlisberger has completed 75.8 percent of his pass attempts.\nNotable is that the Steelers have maintained a balanced attack, using the running game to help insulate Roethlisberger, who has yet to throw more than 25 passes in a game.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1915337"},

{"title": "Steelers capitalize on Dillon's absence", "text": "\nPITTSBURGH -- One of the final stragglers remaining in the \n locker room, from which most players had hustled to the charter buses\n to ponder their first defeat in 399 days, defensive lineman \n was questioned about the pedigree of a \n team that had just quashed the Patriots' record 21-game winning streak.\n\"How good are they?\" said Seymour, eyebrows arched, and repeating the query. \"I don't know, man, really. They won, right? So I guess they're good enough.\"\nA couple hundred yards of concrete corridor removed from where the Pats were dressing, Steelers players openly acknowledged they might, indeed, be \n good enough. Although the Steelers were subdued and maybe even understated in addressing what they had accomplished with their 34-20 bludgeoning of the defending Super Bowl champions, there was a collective sense that this was a special victory.\nAnd that the Steelers, now 6-1 and with only one NFL franchise sporting a better record, might be a more special bunch than anyone had expected coming into the season.\nOh, sure, Bill Cowher invoked the anticipated coach-ese to drive home the point that, even with the significance of the victory, the game still counted for just one win. To some extent, it seemed, his players bought wholesale into the rhetoric.\nBut not for long.\nHaving succeeded in embracing the streakbuster mantle, the Steelers appeared intent on continuing in that role next Sunday here, when the undefeated \n travel to Heinz Field for an emotional interconference matchup. So, consecutive victories over undefeated opponents, for the Steelers? Don't bet against it.\nBehind rookie quarterback \n (now 5-0 as a starter), a physical running game that balances things nicely for the first-round passer, and a very aggressive defense, the Steelers clearly are playing with great momentum.\n\"You know, really, nobody thinks we're the team to beat,\" noted cornerback \n, who blew Sunday's contest open with a 39-yard interception return for a first-quarter touchdown, Pittsburgh's third score in a scintillating 3:33 span that left the Pats in arrears by a 21-3 count. \"So maybe we'll just settle for being the team that beats all of these so-called 'teams to beat,' all right? That would be OK with us.\"\nThe operative term in all of that, no doubt, was \n, because the Steelers simply pounded the undermanned Patriots in virtually ever facet of the contest. Winners of a record 21 consecutive games, New England was certainly backed into a Catch-22 of sorts when tailback \n was deemed too gimpy to play on Sunday, the sixth Patriots starter relegated to the sidelines.\nHis absence all but assured the Patriots would resort to their \"spread\" and \"empty\" pass packages and, in so doing, New England played right into the hands of Cowher and of defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, who spent plenty of time during the Pittsburgh bye last week preparing for those formations.\nThe Pittsburgh defense particularly thrived against the \"empty\" set, a no-running backs formation that New England had used liberally two years ago to torch the Steelers unit. The first time the Pats went \"empty,\" quarterback \n overthrew open wideout \n on the game's opening possession and New England settled for a field goal. On the second \"empty\" snap, Brady was dumped by linebacker \n, the first of his three sacks, and fumbled. The recovery by defensive end \n was followed five plays later by Roethlisberger's second touchdown pass to \n for a 14-3 lead.\nThe third \"empty\" set resulted in Townsend's touchdown. The cornerback recognized a combination in which the Pats send the tailback to the flat and the wide receiver on a curl route. He jumped in front of wide receiver \n, made the pickoff, then sped untouched for the third score in the Steelers' frenetic spree.\n\"That play,\" said Porter, whose monster performance included eight tackles, a pass defensed and two forced fumbles, \"brought the hammer down on them and on that streak, too. That was huge.\"\nIndeed, the Steelers broke out a huge hammer, a sledge, to deliver a message to the Pats and to a rowdy, partisan crowd of 64,737, the largest gathering in franchise history. This was a day, even New England coach Bill Belichick conceded, when the Steelers were not about to be outslugged. That the Steelers absolutely dominated the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball was obvious all afternoon.\nLed by tailback \n, who posted 125 yards on 25 carries, the Steelers rushed for 221 yards, had 25 first downs and owned a whopping advantage in time of possession of nearly 26 minutes. Pittsburgh had six offensive series of four minutes or more, including a killer field-goal drive of 8:35 in the third quarter. On that series, the Steelers ran a dozen straight times, chewing up real estate and the clock.\nNotable was that, even with their offense as balanced as it was, the Steelers were fairly predictable on first down, relying on their offensive line to carve out big holes. Pittsburgh ran on 24 of its 27 first-and-10 snaps, for 116 rushing yards. Amazingly, 95 of Staley's yards came on first-and-10 runs, with the New England front seemingly helpless despite the relative monotonous inexorability of the Steelers offense.\nGetting into the spirit of the holiday, Staley suggested his offensive linemen carved up the Patriots front \"like a Halloween pumpkin.\" While somewhat forced and more than a tad hackneyed, the analogy was an apt one. Center \n and left tackle \n were especially dominant on the Pittsburgh line.\nConversely, with their running game rendered an afterthought with Dillon's absence and the large deficit they faced, the Patriots at one juncture of the contest threw on 26 straight snaps and actually called 29 straight pass plays. New England finished with a measly five rushing yards on six attempts, its longest run of the day for four yards.\nBut the more meaningful glitch for the Pats was four turnovers which led to three of the four Pittsburgh touchdowns and also one field goal.\nPressured much of the day, even though LeBeau didn't blitz quite as much as even some of his defenders felt he might, Brady was often scattershot. He completed 25 of 43 passes for 271 yards and two touchdowns. But his two interceptions were critical and the two-time Super Bowl MVP registered only one completion of more than 20 yards. Fact is, it would not be hyperbole to suggest that Brady was easily outplayed by the callow Roethlisberger, who again demonstrated remarkable poise against a coach who is famous for getting inside the heads of far more experienced quarterbacks.\nCowher went to great pains to once again downplay the performance of Roethlisberger, who took full advantage of a New England secondary that began the day hurting, and lost star cornerback \n  to a lingering foot injury with about five minutes remaining in the first quarter. But there is little doubt that Roethlisberger, who has put together a pretty nifty winning streak of his own (18 straight victories as a starter, dating to a loss to Iowa in the 2003 season-opener for Miami University), has captured the confidence of his more veteran teammates.\nSo just how good is Roethlisberger? And, more important, how good are the Steelers? This is a team, it seems, that can't wait to find out. Next week offers another measuring stick, another undefeated opponent, another chance for Pittsburgh to stake a claim as one of the league's premier teams.\n\"It's another opportunity and, hey, I'm big on opportunities,\" said Townsend, a veteran who has finally worked his way into a full-time starter's role in his seventh NFL season. \"This whole team is big on opportunities.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1913583"},

{"title": "Roethlisberger in demand", "text": "\nJeff Trebac is sometimes sorry he even invented the \"Roethlisburger.\"\nLast month, as the owner of Peppi's, Trebec dreamed up the sandwich of ground beef, sausage, scrambled eggs, grilled onions and American cheese. But ever since the sandwich's namesake -- \n rookie quarterback \n -- has been torching NFL defenses, the demand for the local hero's hero has made lines longer and the space on the grills in his four shops limited.\n\"It's out of freaking control,\" said Trebec, who this week has been selling more than 150 Roethlisburgers a day for $7 apiece, not including tax. Roethlisberger wears number 7. \"People are coming all the way from Ohio (his home state) to get them. The problem is, it's a logistical nightmare. It takes more than 10 minutes to make it and we need more grills if this keeps up.\"\nThose who finish the sandwich, which weighs about a pound, can even buy a t-shirt that reads, \"I tackled the 'Roethlisburger.'\"\nRoethlisberger, who was the No. 11 overall pick in this year's draft, is quickly emerging on the radar of the league's most marketable players. Not only has Roethlisberger become the first rookie in the NFL to win his first five starts since Phil Simms accomplished the feat in 1979, but he also won his fifth straight game last Sunday by stopping the \n' 21-game winning streak. That game was the most watched game on CBS this season, drawing 21.3 million viewers.\n\"We've been flooded with calls,\" said his agent Leigh Steinberg. \"But it's too quick for us to respond because we want him to concentrate on the field. With \n and Steve Young, we waited to do anything major until a few years into their career and it worked out.\"\nSteinberg is also looking for long-term national endorsement deals, which haven't been offered since he was drafted. Local companies have inquired about striking deals to put Roethlisberger's name and likeness on their beverage, food and candy.\nSteinberg's client has already earned several hundred thousand dollars from his deal with Campbell's Soup, his shoe apparel deal with Nike and sports card deals.\nRoethlisberger's Steelers No. 7 was ranked No. 24 on the NFLShop.com's list of best-selling jerseys in data compiled through sales on Sept. 25. But when more recent retail information is released, sales of Roethlisberger jerseys are expected to inch closer to those of \n rookie and No. 1 overall draft pick \n, who ranked No. 5 on the jersey list.\nLast month, before Roethlisberger and the Steelers vanquished the \n, Cowboys head coach Bill Parcells compared Roethlisberger to Dan Marino, saying Big Ben \"is the best (quarterback) prospect I have seen in 10 or 15 years.\"\nSince Parcells opened his mouth and the Steelers continued winning with a 22-year-old at the helm, more than half of the orders for Pittsburgh Steelers jerseys have been for No. 7, according to Reebok officials.\n\"In the modern era of sports marketing, demand for a rookie quarterback's jersey has likely never been higher,\" said Eddie White, Reebok's vice president of team properties. Luckily, for Reebok, letters come cheap.\nAt 14 letters, Roethlisberger is tied with former Pittsburgh Steelers fullback Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and \n wide receiver \n for the longest name in the NFL. But an authentic Roethlisberger jersey costs $260 at retail, the same as a \n jersey.\nReebok, which is the official supplier of the league, could actually use a big seller. Thanks to \n' abrupt retirement before the season, thousands of jerseys with the running back's name and number, in every size and Dolphins color available, are sitting at the company's warehouses in Indianapolis and Cincinnati.\n\"Ben's jersey sales will maybe help absorb the punch we took in the stomach,\" White said.\nRoethlisberger collectibles are also flying off shelves.\nAutographed draft day photos on Roethlisberger's official Web site sell for $49.99, but those looking for signed action photos will have to pay four times that price. The Highland Mint is having Roethlisberger sign 107 autographed photos this week and the suggested retail for those that managed to get in on the deal is $200.\n\"If he wins this weekend, it's probably going to go up to $300,\" said Vince Bohbot, vice president of The Highland Mint. \"Steelers fans have been waiting for a star like this for a long time and I think a lot of people already think that he is the missing piece.\"\nPrices of autographed Roethlisberger cards have already skyrocketed. An autographed jersey card of Roethlisberger sold for $711 on eBay on Monday night.\nSports marketer Frank Vuono says that the fact that Roethlisberger plays for the Steelers is very appealing to memorabilia dealers.\n\"It's a national team that has a tremendous amount of fans,\" said Vuono, one of the founders of The Quarterback Club, the marketing alliance in the 90s that pooled all the rights of the league's quarterbacks for marketing purposes.\n\"There was a time before the draft that we thought that Ben might go to New York,\" said Steinberg, who represented former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback \n. \"But there are many ways, from a marketing perspective, that Pittsburgh is better for him. He has the upbringing, temperament and toughness of this blue-collar town and (Steelers head coach) Bill Cowher's jutting chin juxtaposes with the way Ben is willing to throw his body into the pile.\"\nSteinberg says he has no intention of calling Trebac any time soon to insist that his client get a cut of sales from the \"Roethlisburger.\"\n\"We'll let it run for a little while, since it's funny more than anything,\" Steinberg said. \"You can get into policing it, but we probably wouldn't do that unless a major chain started doing something.\"\nSteinberg should pay attention.

{"title": "Jags QB could still need surgery", "text": "\nNotwithstanding the confusing and cryptic reports about the knee injury suffered by Jacksonville quarterback \n last weekend, a setback could dramatically affect the playoff viability of the emerging young Jaguars.\nThere is still a chance that Leftwich, the centerpiece of the Jacksonville offense, will need surgery on his injured left knee. If that occurs, then there is a chance the Jags' young star could miss the balance of the season.\n\"It could be, in the end, that he does indeed need surgery,\" acknowledged Jacksonville coach Jack Del Rio.\nThat admission certainly is counter to earlier reports that a Tuesday examination by noted orthopedic specialist Dr. James Andrews of Birmingham, Ala., indicated that surgery was not needed and that Leftwich would likely be sidelined 4-6 weeks, the normal recovery period for a slightly torn lateral collateral ligament.\nAs some of the secrecy lifts on the Leftwich injury, and the facts become clearer, it is obvious there is more going on here.\nFor starters, Andrews, who will examine Leftwich again Monday, at which time a more definitive prognosis will be made, is still unsure about the extent of the structural damaged to the knee. Second, that damage to the left knee, according to several sources, extends beyond the lateral collateral ligament.\nEven Leftwich, who once played a college game with a broken leg, conceded there is more extensive damage.\n\"Believe me,\" Leftwich told the Florida Times-Union, it's two different injuries.

{"title": "Burress rejuvenated with Roethlisberger at QB", "text": "\nTwo years ago, then-Ravens tight end \n, in a bit of pre-game trash talking, called Pittsburgh's \n \"Plexiglas.\" It was clever and, to be honest, a little funny.\nWhat's funny about the nickname now is that instead of being broken, Burress is doing the breaking. First he went about breaking the bad habits that had helped to prevent him from living up to his status as the eighth overall selection of the 2000 draft. And just about every week he's making a game-breaking play.\nRejuvenated since rookie \n began running the Steelers' show, and now redeemed from his early offseason run in with the bosses, Burress has caught 18 passes for 376 yards, an average of almost 21 yards a catch, and four touchdowns in Big Ben's five starts. This after catching just three passes for 43 yards in the first two games when \n was the quarterback. Burress's four touchdowns have all come in Pittsburgh's last three games, and they equal his total from last season.\nIn the Steelers' total annihilation of previously-unbeaten New England last week, Burress made a pair of acrobatic touchdown catches to put Pittsburgh ahead, 14-3. He's had a catch of at least 30 yards in five straight games. He and Roethlisberger have been especially dangerous on broken plays when Big Ben breaks containment.\nIn speaking with reporters after Pittsburgh broke the Patriots' record 21-game wining streak in posting its fifth straight win and sixth in seven games this season, Burress credited the coaching he's received for his maturation as a receiver.\n\"I've got an offensive coordinator (former tight ends coach Ken Whisenhunt) who has a lot of faith in my ability to play the game,\" Burress said. \"And (wide receivers) coach (Bruce) Arians, he's teaching me the finer points of the game. No disrespect to coach (Kenny) Jackson last year. He was teaching more from a wide receivers standpoint for the past three years. Now that I have coach Arians, he teaches me from a quarterback standpoint and what they're seeing.\n\"I've been so lucky to have a coach who teaches me things to enhance my game. Sometimes, he thinks I don't listen to him when he's talking, but I do.\"\nHe added, \"That's not a statement game for me, but it was a statement game for our team. We feel like we can go out and compete with anybody on any Sunday.\"\nBurress, who is in the final year of his rookie contract, made a statement himself this offseason to the Steelers that he wanted an extension when he broke protocol and was the team's only unexcused absentee from its May minicamp. He also skipped voluntary workouts, choosing instead to work out on his own at the University of Miami.\nPeople in Pittsburgh didn't appreciate Burress's boycott, but they couldn't argue with the results. Burress arrived at training camp focused and in optimum condition, sending a message that he was ready to follow up his disappointing 2003 with a big year.\n\"I think everybody was pleasantly surprised,\" Arians said. \"He had his reasons for doing what he did, and I'm not going to hold that against him. The day he showed up, he was in great condition and he caught everything in sight. Never took a play off. Hot days. Humid days. The littlest of drills he was going full speed.\"\n\"If I would have been (in Pittsburgh),\" Burress explained to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \"I wouldn't have been getting the work I got down there in Miami. It's different workouts, the intensity. It's something I had never done before. It's something I wanted to do. So I took it upon myself, I took all the shots and everything that everybody said bad. But I was down there working my butt off. I felt it was more important to get myself ready, physically, coming into the season to best suit my team, to help my team.\"\nThe best way to do so, and in the process help his bargaining position come negotiation time, was to correct the technical flaws in his game. \"He can wake up and be able to run,\" Whisenhunt said. Burress woke up one day late last season and decided to commit himself to becoming a complete receiver. Whisenhunt said he noticed that the light went on with about five games left in the Steelers' 6-10 season, and Burress began to spend more time in the darkness of the film room.\nBurress's new attitude carried over into 2004. Arians, who was Peyton Manning's first quarterback coach in Indianapolis, compares the work ethic Burress displayed to that of \n. He displayed \"an attitude that he wants to be great,\" said Arians, who joined the Steelers staff in January. \"He came in wanting to get better.\" During the spring he developed a serious relationship with the Jugs machine, and after every training camp practice he and the other receivers spent extra time catching balls. Confidence: up. Drops: down.\nBurress and Arians evaluated the receiver's stance, his releases, and his breaks. One of the knocks against Burress is that despite his being a physical specimen at 6-5 and 226 pounds, he isn't very physical and struggles against press coverage. His routes are crisper, and while he still doesn't manhandle corners, he's improved, Arians said, having picked up a few pointers on how to beat jams and stealing a slap move from studying former Cowboy Michael Irvin.\n\"He's becoming a more physical guy and (better at) using his body presence,\" Arians said.\nBurress is blocking better. His attitude about his job is better.\n\"He's improved it a great deal because it's become more important to him,\" Whisenhunt said. \"He's matured as a football player. He understands that on this level he has to be disciplined because guys are too good. How he releases off the ball, his break points, how he comes out of his routes, how he's catching the ball -- earlier in his career some of those things weren't important to him. The little details of playing the receiver position are what he's started to focus on.\"\nBurress' value to the Steelers can't be measured in his receiving numbers (he's also a frequent victim of pass-interference penalties). Defenses have to pay close attention to Burress because he's a big play threat. He draws most of the double teams and gets coverages rolled his way. His presence takes pressure off the other members of Pittsburgh's tremendous trio of receivers, \n and \n.\nSalary numbers are a different story. The Steelers plan to wait until after the season to address Burress' contract. If he keeps it up, he'll at least crack the bank if he doesn't break it. He'll likely want a deal similar to the one Miami's \n signed in the offseason, worth $32.5 million over six years, with $11 million in bonuses. The Steelers want to retain Burress and there is optimism within the organization that they'll be able to do so. If it comes to it, they'll use the \"franchise\" tag (valued at $7.22 million this year) to keep him from becoming an unrestricted free agent. Burress has given the team indications that he wants to stay.\n\"The contract will take care of itself,\" Burress told the Post-Gazette last month. \"All I can do is go out and, if I'm not getting the ball, get open, block and put it all out there for everybody to see.\"\nRoethlisberger has expressed privately his desire not to see Burress leave. The two live in the same town house complex in Pittsburgh, hang out together, and chill at each other's cribs. They have a rapport on and off the field.\nThe Steelers have a good thing going with Roethlisberger and the receivers.

Brown still has two more years, beyond this season, remaining on his original rookie contract.\n\"The most important part is that I'm glad the Eagles believe in\n\nme, an organization that drafted me and gave me a chance to pursue\n\nmy NFL career,'\" Brown said.  \"Now I'm more than anxious to prove\n\nthat I can be worthy of the signing.\"\nJason Chayut of the Manhattan-based agency Sportstars negotiated the extension, with input from partners Brian Mackler and Alan Herman.\nThe early deal is typical of the method that Eagles officials, particularly team president Joe Banner, employ to retain key players. Perhaps more so than any franchise in the NFL, the Eagles identify core players early in their careers, and then attempt to strike extensions. It is an effective philosophy that has made Banner arguably the top salary cap manager in the league and has rarely backfired.\nIt also permits the Eagles to keep key young players out of the free agency market for an extended period.\nJust last week, the club signed second-year wide receiver \n to a five-year extension, and Banner told ESPN.com at the time he was working on several more deals with standout young players. It is believed the Eagles are in negotiations with starting strong safety \n on a long-term extension, although it remains uncertain if that contract will be consummated.\nTeams must sign players to extensions by early next week to have a portion of the new money count as base salary for 2004. It is a way of using spare cap room in the current season and Philadelphia, which always seems to have wiggle room under the limit, has taken advantage of the mechanism for several years. Essentially, the club has found it to be a win-win situation, and that should be the case with Brown, who is in his first full season as a starter.\nExtra cap room cannot be carried forward into a future season, and the Eagles annually seem to focus on the \"use it before you lose it\" approach.\n\nA former South Carolina standout, Brown was the third of three defensive backs chosen by the Eagles in 2002, following fellow cornerback \n in the first round and Lewis with a second-round pick. At the time, it marked only the second time in NFL history that a club exercised each of its top three choices on defensive backs, and there has now been one instance since then.\nLooking down the road, planning well for the future, Eagles brass understood that star cornerbacks \n and \n were getting older and would soon have to be replaced. Their foresight has worked out splendidly. Lewis moved into the lineup in '03 and Brown and Sheppard took over as starters this year, after both Vincent (to Buffalo) and Taylor (to Seattle) departed as unrestricted free agents.\nWhile some observers were skeptical of the secondary overhaul, and of the ability of Brown and Sheppard to shoulder the load, the tandem has performed well.\nThe well-grounded Brown, a thoughtful and insightful player who credits Vincent for much of his success, has 39 tackles, two sacks and five passes defensed. A very tough-minded player, Brown, 25, has now appeared in 39 contests, with 10 careers starts, and has 94 tackles, four sacks, two forced fumbles and three interceptions.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1916381"},
{"title": "Roethlisberger in demand", "text": "\nJeff Trebac is sometimes sorry he even invented the \"Roethlisburger.\"\nLast month, as the owner of Peppi's, Trebec dreamed up the sandwich of ground beef, sausage, scrambled eggs, grilled onions and American cheese. But ever since the sandwich's namesake -- \n rookie quarterback \n -- has been torching NFL defenses, the demand for the local hero's hero has made lines longer and the space on the grills in his four shops limited.\n\"It's out of freaking control,\" said Trebec, who this week has been selling more than 150 Roethlisburgers a day for $7 apiece, not including tax. Roethlisberger wears number 7. \"People are coming all the way from Ohio (his home state) to get them. The problem is, it's a logistical nightmare. It takes more than 10 minutes to make it and we need more grills if this keeps up.\"\nThose who finish the sandwich, which weighs about a pound, can even buy a t-shirt that reads, \"I tackled the 'Roethlisburger.'\"\nRoethlisberger, who was the No. 11 overall pick in this year's draft, is quickly emerging on the radar of the league's most marketable players. Not only has Roethlisberger become the first rookie in the NFL to win his first five starts since Phil Simms accomplished the feat in 1979, but he also won his fifth straight game last Sunday by stopping the \n' 21-game winning streak. That game was the most watched game on CBS this season, drawing 21.3 million viewers.\n\"We've been flooded with calls,\" said his agent Leigh Steinberg. \"But it's too quick for us to respond because we want him to concentrate on the field. With \n and Steve Young, we waited to do anything major until a few years into their career and it worked out.\"\nSteinberg is also looking for long-term national endorsement deals, which haven't been offered since he was drafted. Local companies have inquired about striking deals to put Roethlisberger's name and likeness on their beverage, food and candy.\nSteinberg's client has already earned several hundred thousand dollars from his deal with Campbell's Soup, his shoe apparel deal with Nike and sports card deals.\nRoethlisberger's Steelers No. 7 was ranked No. 24 on the NFLShop.com's list of best-selling jerseys in data compiled through sales on Sept. 25. But when more recent retail information is released, sales of Roethlisberger jerseys are expected to inch closer to those of \n rookie and No. 1 overall draft pick \n, who ranked No. 5 on the jersey list.\nLast month, before Roethlisberger and the Steelers vanquished the \n, Cowboys head coach Bill Parcells compared Roethlisberger to Dan Marino, saying Big Ben \"is the best (quarterback) prospect I have seen in 10 or 15 years.\"\nSince Parcells opened his mouth and the Steelers continued winning with a 22-year-old at the helm, more than half of the orders for Pittsburgh Steelers jerseys have been for No. 7, according to Reebok officials.\n\"In the modern era of sports marketing, demand for a rookie quarterback's jersey has likely never been higher,\" said Eddie White, Reebok's vice president of team properties. Luckily, for Reebok, letters come cheap.\nAt 14 letters, Roethlisberger is tied with former Pittsburgh Steelers fullback Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and \n wide receiver \n for the longest name in the NFL. But an authentic Roethlisberger jersey costs $260 at retail, the same as a \n jersey.\nReebok, which is the official supplier of the league, could actually use a big seller. Thanks to \n' abrupt retirement before the season, thousands of jerseys with the running back's name and number, in every size and Dolphins color available, are sitting at the company's warehouses in Indianapolis and Cincinnati.\n\"Ben's jersey sales will maybe help absorb the punch we took in the stomach,\" White said.\nRoethlisberger collectibles are also flying off shelves.\nAutographed draft day photos on Roethlisberger's official Web site sell for $49.99, but those looking for signed action photos will have to pay four times that price. The Highland Mint is having Roethlisberger sign 107 autographed photos this week and the suggested retail for those that managed to get in on the deal is $200.\n\"If he wins this weekend, it's probably going to go up to $300,\" said Vince Bohbot, vice president of The Highland Mint. \"Steelers fans have been waiting for a star like this for a long time and I think a lot of people already think that he is the missing piece.\"\nPrices of autographed Roethlisberger cards have already skyrocketed. An autographed jersey card of Roethlisberger sold for $711 on eBay on Monday night.\nSports marketer Frank Vuono says that the fact that Roethlisberger plays for the Steelers is very appealing to memorabilia dealers.\n\"It's a national team that has a tremendous amount of fans,\" said Vuono, one of the founders of The Quarterback Club, the marketing alliance in the 90s that pooled all the rights of the league's quarterbacks for marketing purposes.\n\"There was a time before the draft that we thought that Ben might go to New York,\" said Steinberg, who represented former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback \n. \"But there are many ways, from a marketing perspective, that Pittsburgh is better for him. He has the upbringing, temperament and toughness of this blue-collar town and (Steelers head coach) Bill Cowher's jutting chin juxtaposes with the way Ben is willing to throw his body into the pile.\"\nSteinberg says he has no intention of calling Trebac any time soon to insist that his client get a cut of sales from the \"Roethlisburger.\"\n\"We'll let it run for a little while, since it's funny more than anything,\" Steinberg said. \"You can get into policing it, but we probably wouldn't do that unless a major chain started doing something.\"\nSteinberg should pay attention. The way Roethlisberger is playing, Peppi's may turn into a major chain sometime in the very near future.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1915377"},

{"title": "Steelers' talent part of Roethlisberger's success", "text": "\nFor any NFL franchise, a Dan Marino-type quarterback might come around once in a lifetime. That might be the case with rookie phenom \n.\nNot since Terry Bradshaw has a Steelers quarterback generated this much excitement. He's 5-0 as a starter. His 70.1 completion percentage is almost 12 percentage points better than Marino's rookie record of 58.4, and his nine touchdown passes puts him on pace to top Marino's 1983 rookie record of 1983.\nBut one thing is certain, while the NFL is a copycat league, Roethlisberger won't make teams change the way they think about starting rookie quarterbacks. Remember, the Steelers had no plans to play Roethlisberger this season. \n was the starter and the franchise drafted Roethlisberger with the idea of giving him a year to work out the transition from being a MAC shotgun quarterback into being an NFL pocket passer.\nHis success is related more to the team that drafted him than the concept of \"giving rookies a try.\" That's why the Giants are wise in sitting \n for the season and the Chargers will benefit from \n' hot play letting \n wait a season to play. Roethlisberger's success makes people forget that the NFL ruins more top quarterback prospects than it develops. \nAsk Brian Billick in Baltimore. He's had to walk a fine line in the development of \n.\nHe believes in Boller and his faith in the second year quarterback isn't wavering despite the team's puny offensive numbers. The Ravens rank 30th averaging just 259.9 yards a game and 12.5 points. Even thought Billick is one of the league's biggest stats fans, he's all about winning. While Boller's stats are below average -- 57.8 percent completions, 5.8 yards per pass, a touchdown to interception ratio of three-to-six and a quarterback rating of 65.3 -- the most important stat to Billick is that the Ravens are 9-7 with Boller as their starter.\nIf you got Billick to look at things analytically, he'd tell you Boller's stats would be better if his receiving corps had more talent. It's not as though general manager Ozzie Newsome didn't try. The Ravens made the trade with the 49ers to get \n. The impact of Owens has improved Donovan McNabb's completion percentage from 57 to 64 percent and he's in his sixth year. Think how much Owens would have helped Boller.\nSo why rush Boller? Billick took a calculated gamble that the Ravens defense was good enough to keep them in games, and that halfback \n was enough to carry most of the offense. This year, Lewis is averaging 21 carries and almost 100 yards rushing a game. Where the pressure falls on Boller is to convert third downs and make a few big downfield throws.\nUnfortunately for the Ravens, they don't have big time receivers. The Ravens have been without tight end \n -- easily their best receiver -- since Week 2. Their leading receiver is Randy Hymes, a converted quarterback, who has only 17 catches for 229 yards and had only six career receptions heading into this season.\nNo matter how he juggles them, Billick doesn't have the receivers to get the best out of Boller.\nGive the Ravens one of the Steelers' three receivers -- \n, \n or \n -- and Boller might not have Ravens fans grinding their teeth with impatience.\nThere is one underlying truth and it's that a quarterback's success is a direct byproduct of the talent around him.\nQuarterbacks drafted in the first round generally go to losing teams. Since 1970, there have been 73 first-round quarterbacks. Would it be a surprise to tell you that of that group of 73, only six have winning records as rookies with four or more starts? Those six are Phil Simms of the Giants (6-5 in 1979), Marino of the Dolphins (7-2 in 1983), Jim Everett of the Los Angeles Rams (3-2 in 1986), Steve Walsh of the Cowboys (6-5 in 1990), \n of the Panthers (7-6 in 1995) and Roethlisberger (5-0).\nOne of the big reasons for Roethlisberger's success is that he slipped to a Steelers team that was much better than the No. 11 position in the draft. The draft is in reverse order of finish, and injuries and a shaky secondary dropped a Steelers team that was probably closer to a 10-6 team to 6-10 and the No. 11 spot. Injuries plagued their offensive line last season, but line coach Russ Grimm patched everything together this season despite the season-ending loss of guard \n. Runnig back \n was signed and he's averaging 101 yards a game rushing.\nBill Cowher headed into the season with a plan to run the ball more and not put the pressure on Maddox to win games through the air. Whoever quarterbacked this team was going to have success because the blend was right -- conservative game plan to set up third-and-3s instead of third-and-10s, a good offensive line and dependable receivers.\nGo back to the 1983 draft involving Marino. There were crazy notions heading into the draft that Marino might be involved in drugs. Covering the NFL at the time in Pittsburgh and watching Marino develop since high school, I and most everyone in the town knew that wasn't true. Still, there were doubts, and the quarterback class was the richest in NFL history that year.\nMarino dropped all the way to No. 27 in the first round to a playoff-caliber team in Miami with Don Shula as its coach. The recipe was perfect for success. The Dolphins had the Marks Brothers at receiver -- Mark Clayton and Mark Duper. They had a great scheme, good offensive line blocking and a smart coach. Marino went 7-2. He completed 58.4 percent of his passes for 2,210 yards, 20 touchdowns and a 96 quarterback rating.\nThe other quarterbacks taken in the first round that year combined for six wins and four touchdowns.\nThe key to the idea of using a rookie quarterback is not expecting him to turn the team around. Until Marvin Lewis took over in Cincinnati, they ruined quarterbacks like David Klingler and \n by hoping they would succeed in a huddle filled with substandard players.\nAs good as Roethlisberger is this year, he wouldn't be able to compensate for bad offensive line blocking, a lack of a running game or poor play by his receivers. Of the three other quarterbacks drafted in the first round this year, only Eli Manning would have had a good chance to do well as a rookie. The Giants have a great runner in \n and two very good receivers \n and \n. The offensive line blocking is adequate, but not up to Pittsburgh's standards at the moment.\nRivers would have struggled mightily had he started for the Chargers in the first half of the season. Though the offensive line has come together under the coaching of Hudson Houck, the Chargers early season receiving corps would have made things very hard for Rivers. He'd have a better chance now with a healthy \n and two receiving threats -- tight end \n and wide receiver \n.\nThe NFL is in the beginning of one of its greatest stints for quarterbacks. By next year, 24 of 32 teams will be run by quarterbacks who are younger than 30 and have been drafted between 1998 and now. Completion percentages are at an NFL record 60.8. Long completions are at a record pace. \nRoethlisberger may be the next Marino, but any other team rushing a young quarterback into action without the kind of talent the Steelers have could find themselves right back in the top five drafting another signal caller.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1916634"},

But the team's leading rusher definitely will play in the showdown game against the \n at Heinz Field, and the number of touches Westbrook gets likely will depend on how he holds up.\n\"I've been feeling pretty good lately,\" Westbrook said after the Friday practice, in which he extended himself to working in every segment. \"Things are going pretty well with the injuries. So, hopefully, I'll be out there. It's all healing. I don't know what will hurt.\"\nWestbrook returned to the Eagles' walk-through Wednesday and participated in some of the afternoon's full-scale practice. He did more Thursday, then took part in all of Friday's preparations.\nIf he does not start, and instead comes off the bench, Westbrook will be replaced in the lineup by \n. Sources close to Westbrook, though, said he prefers to start.\nThe third-year veteran -- who assumed the starting role this season after \n exited this spring in free agency and \n suffered a season-ending knee injury in camp -- suffered a non-displaced fracture of his first rib in an Oct. 24 victory at Cleveland. He also has a muscle strain and chest contusion.\nReid said Friday that the chest contusion, not the slight crack in Westbrook's rib, had been the bigger problem. Westbrook, 25, likely will wear extra protective padding for the game against the physical Steelers defense.\n\"He's running around, and there's no wincing,\" Reid said. Earlier in the week, Westbrook told Reid that he was ready to go and that the decision was up to the coach.\nEagles head trainer Rick Burkholder said just after the injury that the period for full healing of the rib might be four to six weeks but that Westbrook's return would depend in large part on how he tolerated the pain.\nAs evidenced last season, when he returned to the field relatively quickly from a severe high ankle sprain, Westbrook is a fast healer.\nIn six games as a starter, Westbrook has carried 90 times for 458 yards and a touchdown, has a pair of 100-yard outings, and posted 31 catches for 249 yards. While some outsiders were skeptical of his ability to handle a heavy workload at 5 feet 10, 205 pounds, Westbrook has not demonstrated any problems in that area.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1916898"},

{"title": "Injuries could make Eagles vulnerable", "text": "\n \n Timing is everything. Last Friday, when the Patriots downgraded halfback \n from probable to questionable because of a thigh injury, the possibility of a Steelers upset loomed.\nNo team is invincible, not the Patriots, not the Eagles. That's why the '72 Dolphins celebrate the first loss of the last surviving unbeaten team with champagne every season. The 16-game season is one of attrition. Injuries happen, and the more they happen, the more those injuries pull down the NFL's elite.\nThe Patriots weren't the same team without Dillon, wide receiver \n, right tackle \n, cornerbacks \n and \n and fullback \n. The same can be said for Sunday's game between the Eagles and Steelers, the featured game of the week.\nThe Eagles might not have the same offense that's been averaging 26.6 points a game. Halfback \n will play but could be limited by his rib injury. Wide receiver \n and guard \n are both listed as questionable. Minus Westbrook, the Eagles scored 15 points against a great Ravens defense. While he'll play against the Steelers, it's unclear how effective he'll be.\nLike the Patriots last week, the Eagles could in trouble against the Steelers. In a normal matchup, the Eagles would be favored. On a neutral site, they'd probably win. But this isn't neutral. Steelers fans are excited. Their team has emerged as the AFC's top seed after beating the Patriots a week ago. \n is the leading candidate for Rookie of the Year and has been given the starting job for the remainder of the season.\nBecause the Eagles are more vulnerable against the run than the pass, Bill Cowher will work a conservative yet effective game plan.\nFor the Eagles to win, they need to score more than 15 points. For one, the Steelers run the ball well with former Eagles starter \n. The Eagles will counter with a banged up Westbrook and \n after \n didn't generate much of a running attack last week.\nNot having Pinkston would hurt because there is a little bit of a dropoff from having \n as the second receiver and \n as the third.\nMayberry's calf injury could force the Eagles to make their second change at guard this season. \n is playing for \n, the rookie star guard who is out for the season. \n has to take over this week at left guard for Mayberry, but he's new to the offense after being claimed on waivers earlier this season. Guards have to be on guard for the inside blitzes of Steelers linebackers.\nThe Eagles seem to be destined for another trip to the NFC title game because they are so much better than everybody else in their conference. But for this week, they are vulnerable, and they are on the road.\nTheir unbeaten streak is on the line just like the Patriots' was last Sunday.\n\n\n \n Mike Tice has to convince his offense that it can play well without \n. Moss has been on the field for only nine plays in the past two games because of a hamstring pull. While Moss may be available, the offense has to develop a personality without him -- even if he talks his way into the lineup for this potential high-scoring Monday night game. Don't be surprised to see the Vikings to go to more of a ball-control running offense. The Colts are quick but light along the defensive line. The Vikings are big and powerful along the offensive line. Tice's biggest decision will be whether to use \n, \n or \n as the featured back this week. Tice knows he can't keep his defense on the field long because \n will pick it apart. He has 22 touchdown passes and if teams try to blitz him he'll just pick them apart. Manning has generated 28 touchdowns in 75 offensive possessions this season. If this is a 10-possession game, the Colts figure to score three or four touchdowns so the Vikings have to wear down their defense.\n \n Ty Law's injury comes at a horrible time. He's down more than a month with a broken bone in his foot and it is forcing Bill Belichick to make concessions in the secondary. \n has to move from free safety to cornerback, losing coverage ability in the middle of the field. And who knows how long Tyrone Poole's knee injury will keep bothering him. Where the timing is bad is that the Rams' four-receiver set is one of the most potent in football. \n and \n are formidable because of their speed and the Patriots don't have the depth at cornerback to match up against them on the road. Where \n needs to succeed is producing three touchdown drives. Bulger has the accuracy to pick zone defenses apart, and the Patriots might give the Rams a 300-yard game. But yards mean little. Touchdowns are the most important goal for the Rams if they want to win this game. The Patriots formula is to stay close in the game until the final minutes and then make big plays to win. The Rams can't just make drives and settle for field goals. If the Rams score touchdowns, the Patriots' losing streak might reach two games.\n\n\n \n For whatever reason, the Broncos defense is in a slump. It's giving up too many big pass plays. In the past two games, the Broncos have surrendered a dozen 20-yard plays on defense. That's not what Mike Shanahan had in mind when he traded for cornerback \n. While Bailey isn't the problem, he has given up a few big plays. He will fix that. He's the best cornerback in the league. But if the Broncos don't do a better job of pressuring the quarterback, they may have the same problem this week. Texans quarterback \n comes to town with one of the league's best big-play offenses. \n is a big, fast target. Carr is playing on a sore ankle, which could hurt him, but he will try to test the Broncos deep. The Texans have a lot of confidence coming off beating the Jaguars and they are confident finally on the road. They are 2-1 in road games. The Broncos are on a two-game losing streak and they will need a good defensive effort to turn their season back around.\n \n The Ravens are looking to avenge a 20-3 Week 1 loss to the Browns. There will be a lot of revenge on their minds. \n is back from a two-game suspension and needs to do better than the 57 yards on 20 carries he produced in the first week. He had 500 yards in two games against the Browns last year. The Ravens offense needs Lewis because they are more vulnerable on the left side of their offensive line with left tackle \n out for one month. It will be interesting to see how well Lewis runs to his left, but he's good enough that he should be able to figure it out. The Ravens need Lewis to make the job easier on quarterback \n. Boller had a very good game last week but didn't get any credit for it because the Ravens scored only 10 points against the Eagles. Boller doesn't have big-time receivers. Lewis will allow Boller to throw less passes and hopefully higher percentage passes to his pedestrian receiving corps.\n\n\n \n This is a good matchup that is slipping under the radar screen. The Chiefs are the league's hottest offense. They scored 101 points in the past two weeks. \n has had consecutive games with a quarterback rating around 100. \n is having his best season. \n is carrying the running offense and lighting it up in the passing game. What makes this game interesting is that the Bucs do well against the Chiefs offense. And face it, the Bucs have spent the past month building game plans against this type of an offense. They played the Rams and Bears -- which have the same type of motion offenses -- and had a bye week to prepare for the Chiefs. Plus, this is a different type of Bucs defense. They still use the Cover 2 scheme as a base but they are using more man-to-man schemes. The Chiefs are hot, but this is the type of defense that will be tough to blow out.\n \n The Saints come in rested and they are a dangerous team. They have the receivers to exploit the holes in the Chargers secondary. They also have a quarterback \n, who can put 30 points on the board against any defense. Then, there is halfback \n, who has had the bye week to rest an ankle that was probably letting him run at only 60 percent. The Chargers have their own bye week issues. If the Chargers can win before hitting their bye week, they could be a tough team for the rest of the season. \n has been playing at 80 percent because of a groin injury. Given two weeks to rest, Tomlinson should be unstoppable during the final seven weeks of the season. The key, though, is getting to 6-3 before the bye. What makes Drew Brees' job easier is his two main receiving targets -- tight end \n and wide receiver \n.\n\n\n \n Bill Parcells is thin at wide receiver and at defensive tackle and at cornerback. That's a dangerous combination in this particular game. \n can hit them for inside runs, and \n can burn the cornerbacks for good plays. To win, the Cowboys need the best game of the year from struggling cornerback \n. Newman draws Johnson, Carson Palmer's favorite target. Palmer's style is similar to Ben Roethlisberger, a big, strong-armed quarterback who can move. In their game against the Steelers three weeks ago, the Cowboys didn't blitz much against Roethlisberger. They must learn from this lesson and be more aggressive against Palmer. This is a critical game for the Cowboys. If they win, they are 4-4 and have a chance. But if they lose, they may start to look at moving \n into the starting lineup in two weeks.\n \n The Jets struggled to a 16-14 victory over Bills Oct. 10 at home, but this will be tougher on the road. Weather could be a problem and impact Chad Pennington and the Jets' passing attack. And the Bills are pretty good on defense, so you figure it's going to be tough for the Jets to score more than 17 points. The pressure will also be on \n. The Jets defense is flying to the ball and driving quarterbacks crazy. Defensive end \n should get a few sacks against Bledsoe. \n may do the same. But if Bledsoe can keep his feet and come up with some big completions to \n and \n, they might be able to pull an upset. AFC East games are usually low-scoring, and this is one that figures to follow that script. That gives the Bills a chance.\n\n\n \n This game is simple to figure out. If \n' ankle is healthy enough for him to play, the Lions have a good chance to win. \n's success or failure is determined by what weapons he has available. The running game hasn't gotten going yet, and figures to be stalled against the Redskins. So, Harrington needs Williams. The Redskins defense is one of the best in the league because of their aggressive blitzing scheme. The Redskins have been getting great cornerback play from \n and \n, but if the Lions don't have a 100-yard receiver available, Harrington will be in trouble. The Redskins blitz right from the coin toss. Harrington needs a good running game to counter that blitz, but if he can survive without committing turnovers, the Redskins may have a hard time winning the game. Face it, the Redskins offense isn't generating much.\n \n A week ago, Mike Holmgren cut down on his passing scheme to simplify things. The strategy worked and \n rushed for 195 yards against the Panthers. Wide receivers \n, \n and \n all have bad ankles so Holmgren will put even more on Alexander's shoulders. \n will also have to get tight ends \n and \n more involved. Instead of three- and four-receiver sets, the Seahawks will probably have to work more in two tight end approaches. The 49ers will be looking for revenge after losing to the Seahawks, 34-0 in Week 3. But to win, they need a healthy \n, which they haven't had much this season.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&page=/ten/2004week9"},

{"title": "WRs finding more room to operate", "text": "\nLate in the first quarter of last week's streak-busting victory over New England, coach Bill Cowher briefly departed the boundary of the field and moved to the bench area for a typically passionate discussion with the \n wide receivers corps.\nAs documented by the omnipresent NFL Films cameras, Cowher emphatically instructed the trio of \n, \n and \n to keep running routes as aggressively as possible and to encourage contact in the Patriots secondary. \"If there's contact, they'll call it,\" said Cowher, referring to the re-emphasis this season on contact by defenders outside of the five-yard legal zone. \"Believe me, they'll call it.\"\nIronically, a New England secondary ravaged by injuries to starting cornerbacks \n and \n, and whose mugging of Indianapolis receivers in last season's AFC championship game precipitated the focus on the illegal contact rule in 2004, wasn't flagged for a single penalty. That said, Cowher's characterization of the new awareness of game officials for enforcing the rule, for the most part, was on-target.\nThere remain some teams who still feel their receivers aren't being provided the degree of freedom in the secondary that the league promised this spring -- the Philadelphia staff this week dispatched a videotape to NFL director of officiating Mike Pereira suggesting their receivers were abused by the \n secondary last Sunday -- but the numbers from the first eight weeks of the campaign indicate the zebras are giving pass catchers a lot more room in which to operate.\nOver the first eight weeks, there have been 68 illegal contact penalties, as opposed to 30 at the same point in 2003, a dramatic increase of 167 percent. Defensive holding calls, most of them in the secondary, have increased as well. Pereira noted this week that, under the \n guidelines (French for, essentially, \"hands off\"), there have been 43 more fouls called before the ball is even in the air than there were in 2003. Perhaps the one anomaly is that pass interference calls in the first eight weeks have dropped by about 27 percent from a year ago.\nThe result of all the NFL's offseason legislation: Passing yards per game, which in 2003 reached their lowest point since 1992 (at 400.8 yards), have risen to 429.2 yards. That might not seem like very much, but the league has certainly created the perception that passing attacks are less encumbered in 2004. And if the present yardage numbers hold, said \n general manager Rich McKay, co-chairman of the league's powerful competition committee, they will be among the top five seasons in NFL history.\nIn addition, yards per pass attempt have increased (from 6.64 to 7.12) as have yards per completion (from 11.3 to 11.7), from the 2003 levels at midseason. There have been 674 completions of 20 yards or more, the most at the halfway point of the season in at least the last 10 years.\nTruth be told, scoring is actually reduced slightly from the first eight weekends of the 2003 season . But league officials are confident, given the trend from October, that it will eventually register an increase over the course of the entire campaign. And offenses have scored produced scores on nearly 40 percent of their possessions that included an illegal contact penalty.\nWonder why quarterbacks have posted a leaguewide completion rate of 60.8 percent, a mark that would represent an NFL record if it prevailed over the course of the year? Well, taking nothing away from the incredible accuracy demonstrated by passers like \n, \n and \n this season, it doesn't hurt that their receivers are running through opponent secondaries far less impeded than in the recent past.\n\"As a receiver, the natural reaction is, 'Well, they're still not calling (illegal contact) enough,' you know?\" said Ward, whose 49 catches rank second in the league. \"It's still a little uneven. To be honest, though, no, you're not seeing as much grabbing. There aren't those plays where the (cornerback) has about a yard's worth of your ((uniform shirt), so there is a bit more freedom.\"\nThe fear in preseason, when the officiating crews introduced the re-emphasis of the rule with plenty of flags, was that the alteration would slow the tempo of the regular-season contests and perhaps make games interminably long. Fortunately, that has not been the case, and games have averaged the same three hours and six minutes they did in 2003. And most players concede, albeit some of them grudgingly, that there have not been many instances in which they felt the illegal contact calls had a major impact on the outcome of games.\nEven some defensive backs acknowledged that their concerns that the new emphasis might turn games into a glorified seven-on-seven passing drill have been assuaged, and that they have adapted techniques and coverage schemes to help compensate for not being able to use their hands as much.\nThe biggest complaint from defensive backs is that game officials remain inconsistent in their applications of the rules. There have been some nit-pick or \"phantom\" calls, cornerbacks and safeties insist, and other times when they have jammed a receiver after the five-yard line of demarcation and gotten away with it.\n\"In a way,\" said Steelers cornerback \n, \"it's made you get back to your pure cover roots. There's more of a premium now on technique, footwork, being able to run with the receivers. It's forced us to rely more on our athletic skills. When they first announced it was coming, every defensive back in the league groaned. It was like, 'So there they go again, making up stuff to benefit the offense.' But so far it hasn't been overboard or outrageous and, at this point, the worst part is probably over in terms of having to adapt to it.\"\nIn football, as in life (Mike Ditka used to start off a lot of answers that way when he was a head coach), timing is everything. And so, had the University of Washington been able to go in a different direction in July of 2003, after the Rick Neuheisel debacle concluded in his untimely dismissal, perhaps the school would have landed the head coach a lot of people wish they could now get. That guy: Jim Mora The Younger, who played defensive back for the Huskies, and maintains strong ties to his alma mater, but who is pretty gainfully employed by the \n these days. Make no mistake about it, there is a pretty significant contingent of alums who desperately want Washington to go hard after Mora, an underground movement that has actually precipitated some third-party contact through intermediaries. Once upon a time, like maybe a couple years ago when he was still the \n' defensive coordinator, Mora might have killed to get the Huskies position, which he considered his dream job. But that was then and this is now. And for now, Mora is experiencing an incredible rookie season, with Atlanta in first place and \n starting to make plays in a new offense. Washington might even be able to equal Mora's current contract, reportedly a five-year deal worth $7.5 million, but that won't matter. One of the NFL's rising young stars, Jim Mora, loyalties aside, is going nowhere. No one can blame Washington officials for what transpired in the summer of 2003. Because the departure of Neuheisel came only about six weeks before the start of summer camp, the school had little choice but to turn the team over to Keith Gilbertson, who resigned this week. If the timing had been different, well, who knows how it might have impacted the Washington program, and the Atlanta Falcons as well.\nNow that Steve Spurrier isn't headed back to \n alma mater, don't be surprised to see his name surface in the Pacific Northwest, even if Jeff Tedford of California might become the prime University of Washington target. Seattle, though, is a long ways from the southeastern roots of The Ol' Ball Coach, and it's tough to get in a daily round of golf with all the rain out there. But the fact Spurrier rebuffed the rather avid overtures from the University of Florida is only going to fuel the rumors that he is interested in returning for a second shot in the NFL, where he feels the looser rules in the secondary might actually promote his style of offense. Last week we reported in this space that one fairly high-ranking franchise official, whose team might make a coaching change at year's end, has been ordered by his owner to keep tabs on Spurrier and his potential opportunities. Then colleague Chris Mortensen noted last Sunday morning that the \n could have an interest in the highest-profile unemployed coach in the country. This week, one general manager from another team suggested to us that Spurrier will be on his club's short list if it makes a coaching change. So far all of its is nothing more than rumor and conjecture. A month ago, people close to Spurrier insisted in very strong terms he won't coach again until the 2006 season. For now, while admitting that things are always fluid with Spurrier, we'll accept that.\nA possible one-and-done scenario for coach Norv Turner in Oakland? Given that Turner and owner Al Davis seemed to get along pretty well in the offseason and were in lockstep on key issues, that is hard to imagine. Then again, don't discount it, some Bay Area observers contended this week. Davis deep-sixed head coach Joe Bugel after only one season, a disastrous 4-12 mark in 1997, and this Raiders team might be headed for similar catastrophe. League sources with some insight into the club -- or as much insight as one can get into the Oakland operation -- say Davis has wavered at various times on his support for Turner and his impression of where the club is headed. Likewise, they say, his feelings about error-prone quarterback \n vacillate almost from hour to hour. The one constant, they say, is that Davis is convinced that tailback \n is the one man who might be capable of quickly reversing the franchise's floundering fortunes. \"It's almost too easy to assume that Oakland will be the team most likely to make the big play for (Williams in a trade),\" said one source. \"It's almost too convenient. But I think it's also true that (Davis) covets him.\" One name to remember in the unlikely scenario Davis does opt to make a coaching change for 2005, and to hire a fourth different sideline boss in five seasons, is that of \n defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel. There's no denying Davis prefers that his coaches be offensive oriented. But the Oakland defense is really struggling this year under first-year coordinator Rob Ryan, and there has been considerable griping about him from a few veteran players.\nThe Oakland side isn't the only NFL precinct in the Bay Area where things are nasty. In San Francisco this week, fullback \n and then tailback \n (who, by the way, have never exactly been very chummy) lambasted teammates for their lack of professionalism and dubious effort. The primary target was wide receiver \n (Beasley didn't indentify Lloyd by name, while Barlow did), a second-year veteran who appeared to have a bright future. It's one thing for Beasley to go off. The guy is a long-time and universally respected veteran with considerable perspective. But the fact a guy like Barlow would get into the act -- a player whose own work ethic and ability to play hurt have frequently been questioned -- speaks volumes for a possible lack of leadership in the 49ers locker room. We've never argued with the club's decision to gut the roster of some older and higher-paid veterans. But in tossing out the bath water, some babies got dumped down the drain as well. It might have helped to have retained a player or two like \n, who could always keep a lid on things. We contended earlier in the year that coach Dennis Erickson was doing a good job, that the 49ers played hard every time out and that they were more competitive than some pundits expected. Since then, things have unraveled a bit, and the Sunday night loss to a similarly impaired \n team, led by a rookie quarterback making his first start, was the latest example. For now, management continues to support Erickson, and it should, since he deserves the chance to be around when (or maybe if) the franchises emerges from its current tunnel. But the head coach needs to get a handle on the dissidents and urge his players to keep things in the locker room.\nAn admission here, one that probably won't make us very popular with some peers, that we agree the media doesn't have an inherent right to full disclosure on all matters. It is not a media birthright that sports franchises simply spill their guts on everything. That said, the last few weeks have presented graphic examples of how franchises can paint themselves into corners public relations-wise, when they aren't forthcoming on injury matters to which reporters will eventually become privy. A few weeks ago, the Atlanta Falcons were less than candid about the early-morning one-car accident in which defensive tackle \n suffered knee and shoulder injuries that have kept him out of the lineup ever since. \n This week, the \n weren't exactly open in describing the left knee injury sustained by star quarterback Byron Leftwich in last Sunday's defeat at Houston. Even taking coach Jack Del Rio at his word -- that he didn't know the extent of the injury or the results of an MRI exam when he met Monday with local reporters -- the Jaguars could have recovered in much better fashion once they knew Leftwich's season might be in jeopardy. League teams, the Jaguars included, do a terrific job these days of e-mailing both the local and national media with key announcements. Such an e-mail, at least to the media covering the Jags on a daily basis, might have been in order for the Leftwich injury. Instead, the team came across as trying to hide something, and that made for some awkward moments this week. No doubt, some medical privacy initiatives in this country and fears of litigation if too much information is revealed, have NFL franchises a little antsy these days. But there have been occasions in which purposeful subterfuge has backfired and teams in every sport might be wise to keep that in mind.\nOn the subject of Leftwich, he and the Jaguars will hold their breath until Monday when his damaged knee will be re-examined by prominent orthopedist Dr. James Andrews, but the suspicions are mounting that the news will not be positive. Leftwich's own admission that the damage to his knee extends beyond a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament is ominous. Even some sources close to the second-year quarterback, who at first were suggesting he might miss only a couple games, are now backtracking. If the emerging Leftwich is sidelined, it will be interesting to see how \n fares as the starter, and how offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave tailors the game plan to fit with his strengths. We watched Garrard very closely in camp in the summer of 2003, while Leftwich was still absent because of a contract impasse, and came away impressed. In fact, during the four practices we saw, Garrard was clearly superior to \n at the time, and looked like a young player with starter's potential. What stood out was Garrard's patience and poise. The third-year veteran, who is eligible for unrestricted free agency after the 2005 season, is admired within the Jacksonville organization, and by several teams around the league. He is like Leftwich in many ways -- smart, engaging, a quick study, a natural leader -- but has different physical attributes. Depending on the state of Leftwich's injured knee, Garrard might well have the second half of the year to audition for teams looking for a promising young quarterback. Even Del Rio allowed this week that it might be difficult to retain Garrard, and that the Jags might consider trading him rather than eventually having him depart in free agency.\nCall it a tale of two dinged-up right offensive tackles. ESPN.com has learned Cincinnati strongside blocker \n, a long-overdue Pro Bowl selection in 2003, visited on Thursday with noted orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala., about a knee that has been giving him problems. It marks the second trip to Andrews in recent weeks. No prognosis yet but Bengals officials fear there could be some structural lack of integrity in the knee. Anderson has started 71 straight games and played in 133 of a possible 135 contests during his career. In New England, word is that Pats officials are more concerned than they are letting on about the back problem that sidelined tackle \n for last week's game at Pittsburgh. The Pats had to start little-used \n in Ashworth's spot last week. The situation worsened when left tackle \n went out with a slight head injury, forcing Gorin to the weakside and meaning guard \n had to move outside to tackle for the first time in his career. On another front, the skinny is that Pats wide receiver \n will still require a few more weeks of rest and rehabilitation on his ailing knee.\nMuch of the attention at tight end this season has focused on rising young talents such as \n (San Diego), \n (Miami) and \n (Atlanta). But a young player who also merits scrutiny is \n of Dallas, who is really starting to come on as a steady playmaker for Cowboys quarterback \n. The former University of Tennessee star had a solid enough rookie campaign in 2003, but he never really got over the fact that he slipped to the third round of the draft, and that four other tight ends went off the board ahead of him. The Cowboys brass suspected it had a steal then, but is even more convinced of that now. Witten has enjoyed a breakout two-week period, with 17 catches for 196 yards and two touchdowns. He has at least three receptions in every outing this year and has begun to add yards after the catch, an area on which coach Bill Parcells has harped.\nWe're among those who believe that, for the long-term health of the franchise, Bengals coach Marvin Lewis made the right decision in turning his team over to \n this season. And, under the circumstances, we don't agree with the critics who feel that the second-year quarterback and top overall pick in the 2003 draft has been a bust. What we do feel is that Cincinnati hasn't sufficiently insulated Palmer the way, say, Pittsburgh has protected rookie phenomenon \n. And others agree. Noted one pro scout from an AFC team: \"The Bengals have subjected (Palmer) to too much punishment. When you make the decision to go with what is essentially a rookie quarterback, then you have to commit to certain things, like running the football and taking some pressure off the guy. I mean, sometimes you run just for the sake or running, to keep defenses honest and not have them teeing off on your (young quarterback).\" In seven games, Palmer has averaged 38.0 \"dropbacks\" (pass attempts combined with sacks) and 35.3 attempts. On the other hand, Roethlisberger hasn't yet started a game in which he exceeded 25 pass attempts, has averaged 24.4 \"dropbacks\" and 23.4 attempts in his five starts.\nIt isn't one of the NFL's more heavily publicized deadlines, but teams must sign players to contract extensions by Monday, if they want to apply much (or, in some cases, all) of what essentially is the signing bonus to base salary for 2004. It is a maneuver that allows teams to expend extra salary cap room since the space cannot be carried over into the next season. As noted by ESPN.com in the past couple weeks, the \n use the technique almost annually to extend the contracts of good young players, and this year was no exception, with deals for wide receiver \n and standout cornerback \n. There could be a few other extensions by the Monday deadline. Buffalo has approached second-year corner \n about a four-year extension, but so far the numbers, which include a seven-figure signing bonus, haven't jibed. McGee leads the AFC with a 28.0-yard kickoff return average, has two runbacks for touchdowns, and has played well as a starting corner in the absence of the injured \n. The Redskins are working on a deal for cornerback \n, a player they can't afford to have escape in free agency next spring, but it isn't likely to be completed by Monday. \n right offensive tackle \n this week rejected an extension offer and probably will wait until after the season to negotiate with the Jets or test the free agency market.\nMaybe the Jets should direct some of the money that McKenzie and defensive end \n have rejected in extension proposals and throw it at nose tackle \n, one of many pending unrestricted free agents the franchise will have to deal next spring. Yeah, end \n, who has at least a half-sack in all but one game this season, is having a superb campaign. Ellis hasn't played up to his levels of the past two years, but has been good enough. And second-year pro \n, the club's first-round pick in 2003, has really come on strong. But Ferguson is quietly having a stellar season, with 24 tackles and 3¬Ω sacks. Not bad for an interior defender who has never had more than 4¬Ω sacks in a season. Given some of his past injury problems, teams will be a bit wary of Ferguson, but he will still find a healthy free agency market next spring if the Jets don't retain him.\nIt was an emotional farewell when linebacker \n left his \n teammates this week, to return home to San Diego, where he will undergo surgery on his torn pectoral muscle. While the 15-year veteran indicated he doesn't want his celebrated career to end with an injury, it's all but certain that he won't be with the Dolphins next season. His play, which had diminished in recent years when he simply free-lanced way too much, actually improved a bit during his Miami tenure. But there figures to be a major rebuilding job undertaken in Miami and Seau, who will be 36 in January and is due a base salary of $3.5 million for the '05 season, won't be a part of it.\nIdle thought: How would you like to have the future earning power of \n linebacker/pass rusher \n? The second-year veteran posted 12 sacks in 2003 and has seven already this season. But the best part is that Suggs, who figures to be a double-digit sack guy annually, and will probably someday lead the league, will be a free agent after the 2007 season. And at that point, he will still be only 25 years old.\nIt's always been difficult to fathom how a kicker with a leg as strong as that of Indianapolis' \n, at least on field goals, struggles so much on kickoffs. Well, much to Vanderjagt's dismay, Colts coaches aren't going to try to figure it out anymore. The team has decided that punter \n will handle the kickoff chores. Vanderjagt has just one touchback this season. The league's other 31 teams are averaging 3.12 and only four kickers have fewer touchbacks than Vanderjagt does. Colts opponents have an average starting point of beyond the 31-yard line after kickoffs, an area where Indianapolis rankes last, despite having some tremendous kick coverage players on its roster.\n Amid the team's 7-0 start, Philadelphia kicker \n has been kind of lost in the shuffle. But Akers has hit 12 of his 14 field goal attempts from beyond 40 yards and has seven touchbacks in what is shaping up as another tremendous season for him. . . . In the 107 games played to date that were not tied at halftime, the team with the lead at intermission has won 86 of them, or 80.4 percent. ... The Denver defense, which allowed 13 plays of 20 yards or more in its first six games, has surrendered 12 such \"big plays\" in its last two outings. ... The Vikings are considering re-signing former pro wrestling champion Brock Lesnar, who was in camp with Minnesota this summer but was waived, to the practice squad. With the release of end \n this week, the Vikings now have just eight defensive linemen on the roster and coach Mike Tice would like to get another body into the practice mix at that position. ... Redskins quarterback \n, once known as a paragon of accuracy, hasn't had a game yet this season in which he completed 60 percent of his passes. ... The Jets are 10-2 under Herm Edwards in November. ... Eagles slot receiver \n, with just nine catches to date, has done a nice job of controlling his disappointment at the lack of balls coming his way. But Mitchell is concerned about the dearth of action. ... Cleveland quarterback \n has a passer rating of 106.3 in the Browns' three wins and 52.9 in their four defeats.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1916628"},
{"title": "If he can't practice Tuesday, he might be done", "text": "\nFor five-time Pro Bowl safety \n, the leading tackler in \n history, time is running out in the 2004 season -- and maybe on his career as well.\nStuck on the physically unable to perform list after July surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back that troubled him through much of the offseason, the 12-year veteran faces a fast-approaching deadline for getting back on the field.\nAll players currently on the PUP list have until Tuesday to begin practicing. If Woodson is back on the field by then, it starts the clock on a two-week window during which team officials and coaches can evaluate his progress and decide whether to move the three-time Super Bowl champion to the active roster or place him on injured reserve.\nIf Woodson cannot practice by Tuesday, he must go on injured reserve, meaning that the stalwart defensive back would not play in 2004.\nAt this point, even though coach Bill Parcells has acknowledged he will probably try to get Woodson into practice to buy two more weeks of assessment and rehabilitation, the star safety isn't sure he is close to being able to return. Owner Jerry Jones allowed early this week that Woodson probably will not recover sufficiently to play this season.\n\"There are times you feel like you're making progress, but there still hasn't been a point yet where I feel I'm over the hump,\" Woodson recently conceded. \"It's not there yet.'\nActually it isn't so much Woodson's back that has kept him from practicing as it is a nerve problem that developed after surgery and complicated his rehabilitation. The sciatic nerve has affected a calf muscle and Woodson has lost some power in his leg. His progress in recent weeks has been incremental.\nWhen he had surgery, after debating with himself the merits of the operation, the original prognosis was that Woodson might be sidelined for three or four weeks. But he never got onto the field in camp or during the preseason.\nIf he is forced onto injured reserve, there is a chance Woodson might never play again for the Cowboys, with whom he earned three Super Bowl rings. Woodson will turn 36 in the offseason and, with scheduled base salaries of $3.5 million for 2005 and of $4 million for 2006, he might be too pricey to keep around, particularly coming off an idle season.\nAssuming he is healthy, the classy Woodson almost certainly will have to adjust his base salary to have a chance of being around for '05.

Many people in\n\nfootball believe that around 10-12 years in the same job is about\n\nthe maximum time a coach should stay.\"\n\n\t   There had been concerns among some of the school's top boosters\n\nthat Spurrier's return would be a step back and eventually would\n\nleave the program in another tough situation -- trying to replace a\n\nlegend.\n\n\t   They felt Spurrier would never be able to regain the glory of\n\nthe 1990s, and they openly questioned his desire to recruit and his\n\nmotivation for returning.\n\n\t   Some also were still upset over the way Spurrier left Florida:\n\ncalling Foley from his beach house and dropping the news in the\n\nmiddle of the recruiting season.\n\n\t   Nonetheless, they knew there was a chance Spurrier's return\n\nwould restore credibility and championships to the program.\n\n\t   Now, that task will fall to someone else.\n\n\t   Oklahoma's Bob Stoops, Utah's Urban Meyer and Cal's Jeff Tedford\n\nare considered other possible candidates.\n\n\t   Stoops, who spent three seasons as Spurrier's defensive\n\ncoordinator at Florida, has repeatedly denied any interest in the\n\nGators job. But Stoops might reconsider with his old boss out of\n\nthe mix.\n\n\t   Machen hired Meyer at Utah in December 2002, and Meyer's diverse\n\noffense would be welcomed in Gainesville after Zook failed with his\n\nNFL-style approach. But Meyer has no ties to Florida, which would\n\nmake recruiting tough.\n\n\t   Tedford has spent his entire career on the West Coast, but he\n\ncould be the perfect blend between Spurrier and Zook. His\n\nquarterback-tailored system has turned Cal into one of the top\n\noffenses in the nation, and his recruiting efforts match anyone\n\nelse's in the country.\n\n\t   Florida wants to have a coach in place by mid-December -- after a\n\nfull-blown search-and-interview process -- and the only thing that\n\nseems certain is it won't be Spurrier.\n\n\t   Some close to the 59-year-old coach say he doesn't want his\n\ncareer to end on a losing note and predict he will give the NFL\n\nanother shot. It could come soon.\n\n\t   With Thursday's announcement there was almost immediate talk\n\nthat Spurrier would end up in Miami with the Dolphins -- even though\n\nDave Wannstedt has not been fired.\n\n\t   \"I have not been offered any coaching job by any team, and I'm\n\nnot searching for one,\" Spurrier said.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/ncf/news/story?id=1915954"},

{"title": "'85 Bears haunt Chicago", "text": "\nCHICAGO -- It's Sunday afternoon, and Diana Ditka is sitting upstairs in the downtown restaurant that bears her husband's name. A pair of Halloween cat ears are perched atop her head, but her eyes are on the big-screen television. In front of her, on the table, are her picks for the day's NFL games.\nShe bets the games every week against a friend -- just winners, no spreads -- and cheerfully reports that she's trimmed an $800 season deficit down to a single c-note heading into this Sunday.\nAs an avid football watcher, Diana Ditka knows better than to lay much money on the franchise her husband coached to the Super Bowl XX title 19 years ago.\n\"This team should be better than it is,\" she says. \"It's just a shame they don't have better management. ... Football means a lot to Chicago. When we won the Super Bowl it was like the most important thing in everyone's lives. When they're losing, the fans are very disappointed.\"\nWhat disappointed Bears fans have is an 84-year-old franchise with one winning season in the last eight and no playoff wins in the last decade -- and at 2-5 after beating equally inept San Francisco 23-13 Sunday night, this season is going the same sad direction.\nThus on Halloween night, Chicago remains haunted by the ghost of champions past. When it comes to football, the city is stuck in the 1980s, with a tape loop of old glories replaying endlessly in every fan's mind.\nThat unabated nostalgia is why Super Bowl Shufflers Dave Duerson, Dan Hampton, Steve McMichael, Gary Fencik, Jimbo Covert and Keith Van Horne all have done radio and/or television work in town. That's why, after the ubiquitous \n jerseys in Soldier Field, the second-most popular Bears jersey appeared to be Walter Payton's. That's why the thoroughbred that won the $1.7 million Breeders' Cup Mile Saturday was named Singletary by the horse's owner, Northwestern alum Bill Koch.\nAnd that's why Mike Ditka remains a Chicago icon.\nHis restaurant -- which advertises \"kick-ass paddle steak\" in the Yellow Pages, not your everyday phone-book language -- remains popular. He's all over radio, TV and billboards pitching products, from furniture to scotch to casinos. The Republican party attempted to draft him to run against Democrat Barack Obama for Illinois' vacant U.S. Senate seat.\nAnd when Da Coach tapes his local TV show on Thursday nights at his restaurant, the place is jammed with fans wanting to share his orbit.\n\"It's phenomenal,\" Diana Ditka says. \"I guess everyone's still living in the past, because they love Mike Ditka.\"\nHere's the sobering news for those dwelling in that era: Ditka, an ESPN analyst, also endorses Levitra -- a pretty solid sign that the '80s are long gone. He's not walking back through that door, Bears fans, and neither are Jim McMahon, Otis Wilson and Buddy Ryan. And a new generation of football heroes has not come along to take their place.\nThese are trying times in a bedrock football town.\nThe Bulls won six titles and Michael Jordan was elevated to god status. The Cubs are cute, and they sold out every game this year. The White Sox and Blackhawks have plenty of supporters. But the Bears are the town's most valued sports entity.\nVeteran Chicago Sun-Times columnist Rick Telander says so, and so does everyone else you ask about the sporting hierarchy. The answer is unanimous: When the Bears are fielding a quality team, football rules.\n\"If the Bears are doing good, the whole town rallies around them,\" fan Tim Romano says. \"With baseball it's divided, because of all those stupid\n White Sox fans.\"\nFootball fits Chicago like a broken-in pair of work boots. This is a town that prides itself on having an unvarnished toughness, where they shrug off the winter cold and go about their working-class business. Football -- especially Bears football, traditionally a bruising, defense-first product -- is part and parcel of that.\n\"It's basically still a blue-collar sort of town,\" said Bill Davis, a season-ticket holder for nearly 30 years. He's president of the Machinists Local 701 union, and his tailgating group is heavy on Teamsters and machinists.\nDavis is wearing a Butkus jersey and cooking burgers outside Soldier Field. The Vietnam veteran has a \"Veteran for Kerry\" sticker on his jersey. He says he's missed fewer than 10 home games since 1974 -- \"the year they drafted Walter Payton.\"\n\"Football fits the character of the city,\" Davis said. \"When the Bears are doing good, it's a football town. This year it was a baseball town well into football season.\"\nBut now that the chill is in the air and the clocks have been turned back, everyone knows what season it is. Even if it hasn't been a fun one.\nChicago fans are resigned to cheering for \n, a rookie quarterback with a degree in molecular genetics, and an uninspiring offensive supporting cast. They sold out Soldier Field Sunday night to see two lousy teams, and they were in their seats at kickoff (this is no Lakers crowd). But the fan base is far from happy.\nJerry Sarz, a retired Chicago fire fighter, has held season tickets for 50 years. He saw the Bears win the NFL championship in 1963 at Wrigley Field. He took a bus to New Orleans for Super Bowl XX. He says he'll keep coming to games \"until I can't walk, maybe,\" but he's no fan of the McCaskey family's ownership of his team.\n\"People are getting very disinterested because of things they've done,\" Sarz said.\nA member of Sarz's tailgating crew, Jim Briney, had four season tickets for a number of years. Briney said that when the Bears extended the contract of former coach Dave Wannstedt after a losing season in the 1990s: \"I told the Bears to shove two of 'em. That's telling players that being mediocre is OK.\"\nAfter grumbling about the state of his favorite team, Sarz reaches into a plastic bag and offers a visitor a T-shirt. In a burst of entrepreneurial spirit, he and a buddy had them printed up and have sold them at Lambeau Field to Green Bay fans. Bringing them to a home game is playing to a new consumer group.\nThe shirts read: \"Da Bears Suck.\"\nWhen a 50-year season-ticket holder is handing out \"Bears Suck\" T-shirts, times are tough in an old football town.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/ncf/footballinamerica/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id=1913695"},
{"title": "New Eagles teammates fine with T.O.", "text": "\nPHILADELPHIA -- \n settled into his usual chair behind the table with the microphones up on the stage in the Eagles' NovaCare Complex, ready for another Wednesday of crossfire with the Philadelphia press corps.\nSurely, McNabb must've been thinking, this will be a week free of T.O. After all, \n, \n and the \n are all in the Eagles' rear-view mirror. Moreover, the Eagles are riding a history-making, franchise record 7-0 start -- that has got to be big enough news to eclipse the weekly fascination with \n.\nNot a chance.\nThe first three questions were about Owens -- including one about the touchdown dance that mocked \n, an end-zone celebration that was three days old. Add a follow-up, and two more questions that relate to Owens' impact and contribution to the Eagles' offense, and No. 5 -- who is having the best start of his career -- had to be frustrated.\nBut McNabb didn't flinch. In fact, you will be hard-pressed to find a single teammate who will squawk about the sometimes maddening, sometimes tedious media frenzy that has surrounded this team since Owens arrived. It's been so bad, in fact, that after Sunday's 15-10 win over the Ravens, Owens apologized to his teammates for all the trouble he's caused.\nNo need to apologize, says team leader \n. \"He's a part of us now,\" the Pro Bowl safety said. \"What he does is part of this team. I love him. I love his passion for the game. I love what he's brought to this team.\"\nTrolling through the Eagles' locker room looking for even a hint, a whisper of discontent with, or resentment of Owens, you won't find one. He was such a disruptive force in San Francisco. Why hasn't it happened here? Listen to Andy Reid's explanation:\n\"I think it starts with T.O. and the way he takes in his teammates and makes them feel a part of the whole thing,\" Reid said. \"He doesn't stick himself out in the locker room as an individual. He's part of the team and that's important. And the way the guys have allowed him to be part of the team I think is also a big thing.\"\nIn addition, Reid said, Owens fits into an Eagles locker room that is pretty conservative -- eight Eagles recently head-lined a rally for President Bush in suburban Pennsylvania. In six years under Reid, the Eagles have been devoid of off-the-field issues.\n\"I think you're dealing with a guy that is a great kid,\" the head coach said. \"You never read anything negative about T.O. off of the field ... whether it's family or friend; it's all positive. He's never been a drug abuser or any of that stuff off the field. He's a straight arrow guy and I think that's welcome in our locker room.\"\nStill, Owens' end-zone celebrations and his running commentary, some of it very hard-hitting, is not Reid's style. It's also not the tone that has been used by McNabb, who has been the team spokesman for six years. Reid and McNabb are politically correct, perhaps to a fault. And some in the Eagles' organization believe Owens is just what this team -- which has lost three straight NFC Championship games -- badly needed.\nIndeed, the constant sideshow has diverted attention away from this cold, brutal reality: whether or not the Eagles go 16-0, if they don't make it to the Super Bowl it will be a disappointment in Philadelphia. So, in that respect, Owens has given Eagles fans, and more important, the press, something else to talk about.\n\"He's added spice -- the Giants had Lawrence Taylor, the Bears had Jim McMahon, the Cowboys had Michael [Irvin],\" said one prominent member of the organization who asked not to be identified. \"This team needed a wake-up call. T.O. certainly has provided that.\"\nAs someone once said, \"You can't have the pluribus without the unum.\"\nAnd, of course, Owens has backed up all the braggadocio.\nOwens has passed the 100-yard mark in five consecutive games -- a team record. In league history, only Michael Irvin (7) and \n (6) have done better. Owens has nine touchdown catches. In the entire 2003 season, all Eagles wide receivers had a total of five touchdown catches.\nIn short, it is not an exaggeration to say that no Eagles wide receiver has made a greater impact after the first seven games of a season. Not Mike Quick. Not Harold Carmichael. Not Tommy McDonald, who is in the Hall of Fame.\nYou could be cynical and suggest that's why this strange marriage has worked. Owens is getting his touches. The team is undefeated. But still he is castigated -- at least outside of Philadelphia.\n\"I've gotten a lot of hate e-mails through my website with guys saying how can I embarrass Ray [Lewis],\" he said. \"I responded to some of those guys and I was like 'if I was on your team and I did it, they wouldn't have anything to say about it.' It's just the fact that I'm here and I'm not [in Baltimore] and I knew how and where I could be more successful and everything is working out for me. I think I'm proving a lot of people wrong through what I'm doing out on the field. I give a lot of credit to my teammates, they're helping me do that.\"\nOwens is helping them, too. When the \n came to Philadelphia three weeks ago for a rematch of the NFC Championship game -- a game that saw the Panthers' cornerbacks manhandle \n and the other Philly wide receivers -- Owens made certain there would not be a repeat performance.\nFirst he talked about it personally with Pinkston, and then Owens talked about it publicly, issuing a warning to the Panthers to expect a different attitude when they came into town.\n\"It meant a lot to me,\" Pinkston said. \"It gave me confidence.\" Reid backed it up, calling Pinkston's number in the first offensive series. He caught only three balls for 22 yards, but Owens had sent a message. His teammate had responded and the head coach followed through. There is no doubt Owens is setting the tone in Philadelphia.\n\"He has put some dog in the offense,\" Dawkins said. \"We always had dog in the D, now we got it in the O.\"\nOh, there have been some awkward moments. Owens' longstanding feud with his former battery mate in San Francisco, Garcia, made Reid and McNabb uncomfortable. Both of them talked about Garcia being \"a good guy,\" even on the same day Owens criticized Garcia the week of the game in Cleveland. But, publicly at least, Reid and McNabb have not uttered a single word of criticism of Owens -- not a grunt, or a sigh, or a roll of eyes.\n\"Everyone in everyday life uses something to motivate them or inspire them,\" McNabb said. \"Whatever it takes to motivate you is great. It's nothing to the fact that he talks about it during the week or talks to us about it. It could be just something that he keeps inside to himself to get out there and do extra. Whatever it is, I enjoy it. I take full advantage of it and I hope he finds something for this week. It kind of drives us as an offense to continue to do what we've been doing and just improve each week.\"\nThat's a pretty solid endorsement. And why not? The No. 1 beneficiary of No. 81's presence has been No. 5.\nThis year, McNabb is sporting a 102.9 QB rating -- more than 23 points higher than his career average of 79.3. And his 64.2 percent completion percentage is 7 points higher than his 57 percent career average.\nThe Eagles are averaging 26.6 points per game, fourth best in the league. Last season, they averaged 23.4 points per game, ranked 11th in the league, and ranked 20th in the league in passing yards. So far this season? Fourth.\n\"The thing that helps us is his work ethic,\" McNabb said. \"When he's out there working, he's fully drenched. He's trying to make a big play at all times. Other guys see that and it's a trickle down effect.\"\nAnd, of course, we simply don't know what will happen when the Eagles lose a game and Owens does not agree with the number of balls thrown his way. So far, the Eagles have not had to deal with that.\nRight now, that's not even on the Eagles' radar, not even part of Owens' thinking. Without a doubt, this is the happiest he has been in his very productive, often-perplexing career.\nAfter scoring the game-deciding touchdown against the Ravens, after the Eagles collected their franchise-record seventh straight win to start the season, a flood of emotion bubbled to the surface in Owens. His eyes started to well up. He looked toward the sky to try to gather his thoughts. But there was no stopping the tears.\nHe said he was sorry that his teammates had to answer questions about him every week. He wondered aloud about his personal ghosts coming back to haunt him. It's clear that what motivates him is complex.\nBut the Eagles are 7-0. And there is nothing complicated about that.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=paolantonio_sal&id=1915977"},

But when he arrived for the Steelers' walkthrough on Saturday morning, the hamstring was considerably sorer than the club's medical staff anticipated, and Staley immediately received treatment for the injury.\nTeam officials emphasized the hamstring injury was in no way related to, nor precipitated by, a knee problem that had been bothering the eight-year veteran.\nBy definition, a \"questionable\" listing on the NFL injury report means that a player has a 50-percent chance of participating in the game. But sources contacted on Saturday night said they feel the odds that Staley will start are at least a bit less than 50 percent. A team spokesman said Staley's availability will be a game-time decision.\nIf Staley cannot start, he will be replaced in the lineup by 12-year veteran \n, who has largely been relegated to short-yardage and goal line duties this season.

In essence, Staley has assumed the workhorse role that Bettis once held.\nWhile he insisted this week there were no residual hard feelings between he and Eagles officials, Staley has been looking forward to the marquee tilt against the franchise that brought him into the league and for which he played his first seven seasons.\nThe Steelers running game statistically ranks No. 4 in the league, averaging 147.7 yards per game, and has provided excellent insulation and balance for rookie quarterback \n through the first five starts of his career.\nThere is some irony with the injury to Staley, since it was Philadelphia coaches who spent much of the week worrying about the availability of their starting tailback, \n.

{"title": "Bus, Steelers run all over Eagles", "text": "\nPITTSBURGH -- To commemorate the silver anniversary of this city's fourth and final Super Bowl victory from the \n' dynastic six-year stretch in the 1970s, the franchise brought back many of the heroes from the '79 title team.\nSo at halftime here on Sunday, the Terrible Towel-totin' partisans roared their approval as players like Franco Harris, Rocky Bleier, Mel Blount, Lynn Swann, John Stallworth, Joe Greene, L.C. Greenwood and others made their way, most of them slowly, to midfield.\nBut the throatiest cheers at Heinz Field, where the Steelers for a second consecutive week summarily dispatched a previously undefeated visiting opponent, were saved for an old favorite who wasn't even supposed to be such a significant part of these festivities. With their Little \n) Coupe rendered inactive because of a hamstring strain suffered late in Friday's practice, the Steelers brought The Bus out of the garage.\nAnd in a performance that was as gratifying for 12-year veteran tailback \n as it was appreciated by a loyal fan base that had witnessed most of his 43 previous efforts with 100 rushing yards, The Bus demonstrated he's still got some wheels.\nStarting for the first time this season, after having been reduced by Staley's presence to a short-yardage and goal-line fantasy football novelty item, Bettis blasted for 149 yards on 33 carries in Pittsburgh's 27-3 dismantling of the \n. On a day when the Steelers turned back the clock, the game culminating a weekend in which the Super Bowl XIV team members were feted, Bettis turned back the odometer and was only too happy afterwards to remind a legion of skeptics that there is still some tread left on his 32-year-old tires.\n\"Am I still the running back that I was when I was 25?\" asked Bettis rhetorically, after a Pittsburgh victory that moved the Steelers to 7-1 and will almost certainly make them the NFL's top-rated team in this week's ESPN.com power poll. \"No. But I'll tell you what, I am still a damned good running back. I can still get it done.\"\nBecause of Bettis, and a Pittsburgh offensive line that over the last two weeks has simply imposed its will on a couple highly regarded defensive front sevens, the Eagles' dreams of an unbeaten 2004 season are done as well. Whether it was Bettis, backup \n or even rookie \n doing the damage, the Steelers blasted out 252 yards on the ground, Pittsburgh's best output since October 2001.\nEven when they weren't pounding out yards between the tackles, the Steelers were very effective, their first touchdown in a 21-0 onslaught in the opening 20 minutes of the rout coming on wide receiver \n's 16-yard run on an end-around play that badly beat a Philadelphia blitz.\nThat bit of early gimmickry aside, Pittsburgh became the first franchise in NFL history to earn consecutive victories against two undefeated opponents that had at least six wins each, bludgeoning the Eagles in much the same manner as they had the \n here a week ago. And most of the time, the blunt instrument was Bettis, ousted from the starting job in training camp by Staley. The Bus had held since 1996.\nSteelers coaches officially made the decision to deactivate the ailing Staley, desperate to play against his former Philadelphia teammates, two hours before kickoff. Staley, who is on pace for a career year in his debut campaign in Pittsburgh, tested his hamstring at about 10:15 Sunday morning, jogging from one sideline to the other and then back again. He then shook his head in frustration, retired to the locker room and slipped into his sweat clothes instead of his uniform.\nBettis pretty much knew by Saturday evening, though, that he would be the starter. And, he acknowledged, he relished the opportunity. Clearly, his teammates, who insisted there was no concern when coach Bill Cowher announced that Staley would not dress, relished it for Bettis as well.\nThe offensive line, which has played brilliantly the past two weeks, was crisp in coming off the ball early. On the game's initial series, Pittsburgh went 80 yards in 11 snaps, with 71 yards on the ground, including 34 from Bettis, who carried five times. On the second play of the contest, Bettis powered 16 yards through left guard, and it seemed that both he and his blockers delivered a message with that play.\n\"If the Eagles came here thinking they were going to catch a break because Duce couldn't go, well, we made sure they didn't think that way for long,\" said Ward, who, in addition to his 16-yard run also scored on a 20-yard catch on Pittsburgh's second possession. \"To me, even with (rookie quarterback \n here, and Duce here, this is still Bettis' team. I've always regarded it that way. I mean, the guy can still play, and everyone saw that today. It wasn't like they just handed him a job in training camp. Believe me, it doesn't happen that way. You earn your paycheck, man, and he's still earning his. Look, he is the ultimate Pittsburgh Steeler.\"\nThe sixth-leading rusher in league history, and deserving of Hall of Fame consideration after he retires, Bettis entered the intrastate showdown having registered just 52 carries for 129 yards in the first seven games. Only twice until Sunday had he posted more than 10 carries in a game. But he rushed 15 times for 65 yards in last week's victory over New England, helped the Steelers bleed time off the clock in the fourth quarter of another big, dominant win and convinced offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt that, if needed, he could play an expanded role.\nAlthough he lost the competition with Staley for the starting job, Steelers coaches and many of his teammates insisted even before Sunday that Bettis looked good in training camp and that he still possessed the quick feet that have been his trademark for a dozen years. In scout-ese, Bettis possesses \"little man's feet,\" rare quickness for a such a big man, and a knack for being able to redirect in the hole.\nThose who consider Bettis simply a power back at 255 pounds, or a hammer with which to batter opponents, haven't been paying much attention. His quiet calling card for a long time now has been the innate skill for cutting without throttling down, for making subtle yet significant moves at the line of scrimmage. In Sunday's victory, Bettis demonstrated all of that and then some, right from the outset.\n\"It wasn't so much important to establish me as it was to establish the run in general, because that is our identity,\" said Bettis, who had just one carry for more than 8 yards in the first seven games but five such carries on Sunday. \"For as long as I've been here, the goal has been to run the ball first, and then everything else comes off of that. We've always tried to dictate the tempo.\"\nFor the second week in a row, in that regard, the Pittsburgh offense was as reliable as a monotonous but magnificent metronome.\nPittsburgh rang up 25 first downs and 420 yards, averaged 5.5 yards on its 76 snaps and controlled the ball for 41:49.\nSuch dominance, combined with the early 21-0 lead, allowed the Steelers defense to all but ignore the Philadelphia running game, which netted a pitiful 23 yards, and harass the pocket. The Steelers defense, behind masterful calls by coordinator Dick LeBeau, sacked \n four times. Wide receiver \n, who appeared to get in the face of McNabb at one point on the sideline, had just 53 yards on seven catches. There were no in-your-face theatrics from Owens, but Bettis didn't depart until he had called out some of his detractors.\nHe reminded the media that he had accepted a pretty dramatic salary reduction during the spring to stay in Pittsburgh, that when his role was laid out by coach Bill Cowher he did not chafe, that he still works as hard in practice as he always did.\n\"I'm not a charity case,\" Bettis said. \"I'm here for a reason.'\nAnd on Sunday, all the black and gold-clad zanies who arrived at Heinz Field in part to cheer for their heroes of old found out they have one more old hero still in uniform.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1915283"},
{"title": "Givens continues huge season for Patriots", "text": "\nST. LOUIS -- The afternoon was supposed to belong to the Rams receivers. The Patriots' depleted secondary was missing both its regular starters at cornerback, and when \n left two plays in with a right arm injury, New England had two undrafted guys with less than a season's worth of experience between them playing on the outside, rookie \n and practice squad call-up Earthwind Moreland, who in case you're curious, was named in honor of the R&B band. Talk about being thrown into the fire.\n would pick up where \n left off and light it up, or so most everyone thought going into the first meeting between New England and St. Louis since Super Bowl XXXVI. He'd throw for 300 easy. \n and \n each would get 100 yards. And the Rams were at home, too? Man. \n, \n, \n -- they'd all have their way against the Patriots' DBs. It looked like a David vs. Goliath matchup.\nAnd it produced the same outcome, even though the Patriots had to resort to using 33-year-old receiver \n at nickel corner and at one point reserve linebacker \n at safety. New England held Bulger to 285 yards in part because its zone coverage made him hold the ball long enough for its three- and four-man rushes to get home. And while Holt had 111 yards and a meaningless fourth-quarter touchdown, the best receiver on the field on this day was not a Ram but, appropriately enough, a David.\n.\nPerhaps best known nationally as the co-star of the Sirius satellite radio spot who asks fellow Patriots wideouts Brown and \n, \"I thought I was his favorite receiver,\" referring to quarterback \n, Givens had a Fred Biletnikoff, Super Bowl XI type performance in New England's 40-22 win, setting up three touchdowns and catching five balls for 100 yards.\nGivens is a rising star, a Hines Ward-type at 6 feet and 215 pounds. On Sunday he outshined two other perennial Pro Bowlers, Bruce and Holt, under the lights of the Edward Jones Dome.\n\"There's guys out there that are doing great things, and I feel like, 'If he's doing it, I can do it,' \" Givens said afterward. \"I try to make myself the best player on the field. I may not be physically or I may not be the smartest, but I pride myself on trying to be the best player on the field.\"\nGivens, 24, has been the Patriots' best receiver this season. He's had a career year and it's only half over. Only one of his team-leading and career-high 37 receptions has \n gone for a first down, and he also leads the team with a career-high 644 receiving yards. Sunday was his third consecutive game with at least 100 receiving yards and fourth this season. He's on pace to have the best year, in terms of yardage, by a Patriots receiver since Stanley Morgan had almost 1,500 in '86.\n\"He's a stud. He's definitely ranked up there with the best receivers in the league, in my opinion,\" said tight end \n, acknowledging his bias toward his locker room neighbor. \"He's not catching eight, nine balls a game, but the ones he makes are clutch. They're not easy catches. They're not wide open. It's 20 guys around him. He always catches with his hands. I can't say enough about him. I think he's going to be a great, great player.\"\nThis has not happened by accident, though New England is fortunate to have landed such a productive player with its second pick in the seventh round of the 2002 draft (No. 253 overall) out of Notre Dame. Givens made the team as a rookie because of his special teams prowess, but dropped some key passes that season. Last year, he led the team in touchdown catches (six) and caught one in the AFC championship game and the Super Bowl.\nNow he's progressed from being \"pretty good for a seventh-round pick\" to being just plain good. Sure it helps that he's got Brady as his quarterback and Charlie Weis as his offensive coordinator, but Givens's production is more a product of his determination than circumstance.\n\"You can look at it a bunch of different ways,\" said Fauria. \"You can give credit to the Patriots for seeing something everybody else didn't see. It's definitely a credit to him for not believing what he reads or what he sees. And then just his work ethic. He's a good guy. You knew it from the beginning. A lot of coaches were hard on him. When you see a lot in somebody, I think you ride them a little more.\"\nThey didn't have to last spring and summer. You can guess what's coming next: Givens worked hard in the offseason. Once the Patriots' workout program began in March, he channeled all his energy toward football, declining broadcast opportunities that could have put a little extra change in his pocket, which means more when you're playing for the second-year minimum ($230,000). But Givens wanted neither the distraction nor the attention. Lately he's even been declining interview requests from local media, preferring instead to stretch and receive treatment before practice. The Patriots just love players who think like that.\nOne of Givens's priorities in the offseason was to improve his speed. He learned to sprint with more body lean, shortening his steps, and reduced his 40-yard dash time from around 4.5 seconds to the 4.4 range. He devoured film of contemporaries (\n, \n) and predecessors (Lynn Swann), searching for the nuances of their games. His goal is to reach their level.\n\"I'll tell you this,\" said Fauria, recalling an early-morning encounter with Givens from three weeks ago, \"I get (to Gillette Stadium) pretty early (around 6:30 a.m.). Usually I'm the first one in there. At least I think I am. I go in and I see his chair out. He's not even there, I don't know where the hell he is, but he's not there.\n\"I remember he came in, and I'm like, 'D, what are you doing here so early?' He said, 'I just told myself I was going to put in the extra effort and make sure my body was ready every week.' I think he just made his mind up that he was going to be the man.\"\nHe was a man Sunday. It seemed as though he could get inside on the slant whenever the Patriots wanted. His 10-yard catch on third-and-2 set up Brady's 2-yard touchdown toss to \n in the second quarter. He beat \n for a 50-yard catch later in the quarter that led to \n's third field goal of the half. It stands as New England's longest play from scrimmage this season.\n's five-yard touchdown run in the third quarter came a play after Givens converted a third-and-3 with a nine-yard grab. And Givens's sweet snatch of a Brady pass for 12 on third-and-6 sustained the fourth-quarter drive that ended with Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to \n.\nGivens was an exclusive-rights free agent last offseason, and the Patriots decided against signing him to a long-term deal. It wasn't as if he needed it, but it was added motivation nonetheless. It was a mistake for an organization that doesn't commit many; Givens will attract attention as a restricted free agent in the offseason, and depending on at what level the Patriots tender him, they could lose him.\nBut in the meantime, the former Fighting Irish wingback has found himself as a receiver.\n\"I just felt it was time for me to step up. That was my approach coming into this year,\" Givens said. \"There were things I had to learn about the game, how to get open against certain coverages and so forth. I didn't know them last year. I made some plays, but it was just off natural ability. Now I feel like I'm maturing.\n\"It's just time now. It's time for somebody to step up. You've got first- and second-year guys doing that. It's just my time. Time to shine, really.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=smith_michael&id=1918261"},

{"title": "Plummer thrives in conservative attack", "text": "\nDENVER -- Novembers are defining months in the Mile High City. It's around the time of year when Super Bowl teams gather confidence for the stretch run. And Broncos coach Mike Shanahan thinks only in terms of Super Bowls, having won two with John Elway in the late 1990s.\nBut in Denver, there's extra intrigue. Because quarterbacks play under the enormous shadow of Elway, whose name is legendary and whose car dealerships appear every other mile, Novembers are when Broncos signal callers determine their fate. \n faded as the weather chilled and he's now warming his bones in Tampa Bay.\nNow, \n is facing judgment month. He entered November coming off two losses in which he threw five interceptions and completed less than 60 percent of his passes. With a $6 million option bonus due after the season, Plummer, who signed a seven-year, $40.7 million contract, suddenly finds himself playing for his job.\nPlummer stepped up in the pocket Sunday. No, his performance wasn't flawless. Some of his passes in the pocket sailed, but none went into the hands of \n defenders. Overall, Plummer completed 16 of 24 passes for 234 yards and four touchdowns in a surprisingly easy 31-13 victory over what turned out to be a \"Not-Ready-For-Prime-Time\" Texans team.\n\"I didn't do anything different than I did all year,\" Plummer said. \"We had a great game plan. Guys made big plays. This was a big win for us. We jumped out to a big lead. We ran the ball well. And we took some shots when we wanted.\"\nContrary to his assessment, things were different for Plummer and the Broncos on Sunday. Shanahan's game plan was notably conservative. For the most part, the Broncos operated out of two- and sometimes three-tight end sets to establish the run. Often, only one wide receiver would be flanked to the outside. Tight end \n was the key to this strategy.\nPutzier, a 256-pound former Boise State wide receiver, spent most of the day lined up in the slot of what was often a strange spread set. When two receivers were flanked out with him, Putzier lined up in the slot to draw a linebacker, often drawing outside linebacker \n away from inside the tackle box.\n\"Lining up like that gives us cutback lanes for the running game,\" Putzier said. \"You have a linebacker trying to guard me, and if \n keeps pounding it in there, it's going to open up more things later. When they come inside to stop Reuben, that's when we get our big plays.\"\nPlummer was fine with the strategy. His ears have been constantly burning from recent criticism of his turnovers. Though this might be one of Shanahan's most conservative offensive seasons, the Broncos entered the game with a ridiculous minus-7 in the turnover ratio. Everyone around town knows a continuation of the mistakes would eventually lead to a turnover at the quarterback position after the season. Plummer's contract started out as a two-year, $8 million \"look-see.\"\n\"Jake never wants to cause us to lose a game, and he's always one of those guys who never wants to make a mistake,\" Droughns said. \"He takes all the blame when he makes a mistake. He's a tough guy. He's a fighter. He's the type of guy who never would give up on us.\"\nDroughns speaks for the rest of the Broncos offensive players. They like Plummer. Often, that couldn't be said of Griese, who was said to be much more quiet and less willing to take the blame. As the weather chills in Denver, the heat of the quarterback job intensifies and Plummer's teammates stepped up for him.\n\"It's nice to win going into a bye week,\" Plummer said. \"You guys (in the Denver press) made it more dramatic than it actually was. I had a couple of bad games. As a quarterback, you fight through those. Look around through the league every Sunday and every all-star quarterback doesn't have Hall of Fame-caliber play every Sunday. Sometimes you have some struggles. My teammates stayed behind me.\"\nThe Broncos' first scoring drive actually started at their 1-yard line after the Texans downed a punt near the goal line. Droughns pounded the Texans defense for gains of nine and six yards. Plummer fired a long, safety pass to Putzier, and drew a 36-yard interference penalty by cornerback \n. After two more runs, Plummer caught Putzier open against a Texans zone, and he outmaneuvered cornerback \n for what turned out to be a 34-yard touchdown.\n\"One guy missed me and another guy two-hand touched me, and I got into the end zone,\" Putzier said. \"I don't have any moves. Whatever moves I have, I must have learned them at the stampede (in Idaho) probably.\"\nThe efficiency of the Broncos offense forced Texans coach Dom Capers to make uncharacteristic coaching decisions. An impressive opening drive was wasted by a 37-yard missed field goal. Trailing 7-0, Capers went for a fourth-and-1 at midfield and was stuffed. Plummer drove the team for a field goal.\nPlummer executed touchdown drives of 80 and 53 in the final two minutes of the first half to open a 24-7 lead and make it an early rout.\n\"Today, it was nice not to throw an interception,\" Plummer said. \"We were getting good matchups but I didn't want to risk throwing a pick. Once, \n  made a double move and was open, I didn't want to risk it so I took a sack. Last week, I made some absolutely bone-headed stupid throws. I corrected that today by not forcing things.\"\nOnly once did Plummer get scolded for a gamble. He rolled right and threw a long pass across the field that sailed over the head of \n. A lecture awaited him on the sidelines.\n\"You go through Jake's mistakes and you say you have to eliminate the mistakes,\" Shanahan said. \"You say, 'You are doing a lot of things great and if we can eliminate some of the mistakes then we have a chance to improve and get better.' The great thing about Jake is that he is pretty tough on himself. People forget that other quarterbacks here did throw interceptions. We have a high standard and you have to work through it.\"\nBye weeks are for reflection, and Shanahan can ponder some pretty good stats for Plummer. He's thrown 19 touchdown passes in nine games. He's only been sacked seven times. His 58.4 completion percentage is a little low, but he's thrown for 2,282 yards and has a respectable 89.3 quarterback rating. The one down side is those 10 picks.\n\"He understands the position,\" Shanahan said. \"He understands the expectation level. The thing that's interesting or the thing that I enjoy is that he embraces that type of pressure.\"\nHis record as a regular-season starter in Denver is now 15-5. During Griese's demise, Shanahan fretted about a 60-percent passer with a .500 record as a starter. Sunday's victory over the Texans was the rallying point for Plummer.\nOver the final seven games, he knows he must take this team to the playoffs and perform well in those contests. Sunday was a start. It's November. Plummer proved he was ready for the first of the final challenges.\n\n            \"To come back with the pressure he had on him today, I thought he showed great concentration and focus,\" Shanahan said of Plummer. \"A lot of guys fold under pressure.\"\nMaybe \"The Snake\" is treating this stretch drive like his own personal fourth quarter, a time in which he plays his best.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1918240"},

{"title": "Brees having MVP-type season", "text": "\nThere were many people who predicted, especially during training camp, that this year's NFL most valuable player would be a quarterback from the AFC West. Of course, none of the pundits prognosticated that it would be \n.\nOh, there was some support for \n of Denver, despite his enigmatic career. \n of Kansas City, based on last year's explosive Chiefs offense, got some nods. Heck, even Oakland's \n, a onetime MVP coming off shoulder surgery, merited consideration.\nAnd then there is Drew Brees of San Diego, who wasn't supposed to keep his job, let alone emerge as one of the NFL's premier passers. We mention all of this because, in the Heinz Field press box on Sunday, a group of scribes was sitting around before the Steelers-Eagles contest. Munching on free food (as is the pregame custom to which all card-carrying football writers must subscribe), they also kicked around prospective most valuable players.\nNo one, trust me, mentioned Brees. And now everyone, if they truly devote time to being at least semi-responsible about such mid-season matters, ought to consider the Chargers passer. There are a lot of reasons that the Chargers are 6-3 and that no one mentions coach Marty Schottenheimer as being on the hot seat, but none is more significant than Brees.\nOver the past six games, five of them San Diego victories, he has completed 121 of 170 passes for 1,378 yards with 15 touchdown passes, one interception and a passer rating of 122.4. For the year, Brees has thrown 18 touchdown passes versus only three picks. Brees has now thrown 122 straight passes without putting one in the hands of the wrong team.\nMuch of this has come while star tailback \n limps through a groin injury more severe than either he or teams officials will admit.\nThere is, to be sure, a glut of viable MVP candidates: \n, \n, \n, \n and \n. But take a look at the San Diego schedule and you begin to get the feeling that the Chargers could sneak away with the division title. Take a look at Brees, his numbers, his importance to San Diego, and try to argue he isn't a justifiable candidate for most valuable player honors in what figures to be his final season with the team.\nThe Patriot way\n\nYou didn't really believe that after 21 consecutive victories (sorry, Bill Belichick, we're not adhering to the shtick about 21 winning streaks of a game each), the \n were actually going lose two in a row?\nOn Sunday the Patriots were so undermanned that the NFL brass should have permitted owner Bob Kraft to scrap the club's logo -- you know, the one that looks like Elvis standing a wind tunnel -- for their game against the \n. Kraft could have replaced it with something more apt for the occasion. Our suggestion: The old Revolutionary War trio -- One kid playing the flute, one tapping on a drum, one toting a flag -- and all of them bandaged up.\nForget the play-by-play. New England should have handed out a stitch-by-stitch account heading into Sunday's contest at the Edward Jones Dome. Here's why the Patriots trounced the Rams:\nBecause Belichick and his staff convince every player on the roster that he will be counted on to deliver at some point in the season, and guys pay attention, knowing they will get a chance.\nBecause not even Eagle Scouts are as well prepared as the Patriots.\nBecause, if there was one element of the New England team that was even more wounded than its bodies after last week's streak-snapping loss at Pittsburgh, it was the Patriots' pride.\nThis is a team that makes plays, not excuses, even if you might not know the names of some of the people making key accomplishments. Sure, they hobble, but the Patriots also cobble together personnel packages for all occasions, even if it means a bit of baling wire and duct tape, which was the case again Sunday.\nWith both starting corners sidelined by injuries, New England began the day with second-year \"nickel\" defender \n and rookie undrafted free agent \n on the wings. Then Samuel went out with an arm injury and was replaced by Earthwind Moreland, who on Saturday was elevated from the practice squad. Moreland played with four different teams in 2002, was out of the league in 2003 and went to the NFL Europe League this spring to resuscitate his floundering career.\nIn \"nickel\" situations, wide receiver \n, who practiced some at cornerback in training camp, played on the corner for the first time in a dozen years. Brown, Gay and Moreland combined for eight tackles and two passes defensed. There were occasions when \n, a linebacker by trade, was at safety. Linebacker \n caught a touchdown pass. Kicker \n, who had four field goals, \n for a touchdown ... to Troy Brown ... who, while not playing in the secondary, found some time for his day job.\nTailback \n, a slacker compared to some of his teammates, didn't do anything but run the ball. But he played hurt after missing last week's loss at Pittsburgh and provided New England much-needed offensive variety.\nBelichick and personnel guru Scott Pioli love to find players who can do a lot of things. They love those Vegematic guys, versatile players who can slice, dice and chop. And on Sunday, facing an explosive Rams team and the prospect of a losing streak, those guys paid dividends. It's what the New England brass expected them to do. Count out the Patriots because the training staff has used more bandages in recent weeks than you'd see at a King Tut exhibit? All of the skeptics, and certainly the Rams, should have known better.\nSteeler football\n\nKen Whisenhunt joined the \n staff as tight ends coach in 2001, which means he was exposed for three seasons to the offensive design and play calling of Mike Mularkey, the man he replaced as coordinator. But it has been clear over the past couple weeks, when the Steelers scored big wins against two teams considered the best in the NFL, that Whisenhunt has implemented his own philosophy in a very short time.\nNow the head coach of the \n, Mularkey was among the league's most creative and fertile minds, and it seemed he possessed an endless bag of tricks as he came up with ways to take advantage of versatile players like \n and \n. He drove opposition defensive coordinators daft with a variety of formations and gadgetry.\nAs much as Steelers players enjoyed the gimmickry, it appears they have bought in to the more meat-and-potatoes style of Whisenhunt. Granted, the Steelers' first score on Sunday in the victory over the Eagles came on a 16-yard run by Ward on an end-around play that beat a Philadelphia blitz. And there was a key first down in the second half that resulted from a direct snap, in shotgun formation, to Randle El. But for the most part, Whisenhunt plays things straight, and that likely is one reason Bill Cowher elevated him to the coordinator spot, rather than looking outside the organization when Mularkey departed.\nThe 2003 campaign was the worst ever for Pittsburgh, at least since the 1970 merger, in terms of running the ball. Whisenhunt convinced Cowher that under his direction the team would get back to playing Steelers football, which means pounding the ball relentlessly inside the tackles, while still possessing a potent passing attack.\nIt's not by happenstance -- Pittsburgh offensive linemen were gloating the last two weeks -- that the Steelers rushed for over 200 yards in the victories over the Patriots and Eagles. The identity of the Steelers has been reclaimed, it seems, and Whisenhunt certainly deserves considerable credit.\nSpecial recognition\n\nMy beloved high school alma mater, Pittsburgh Central Catholic, has turned out a few terrific quarterbacks in its time. There was Dan Marino, who is only a few months away from being voted into the Hall of Fame. And then \n, the St. Louis Rams starter, didn't even play football his first few years in high school.\nAnd, oh, yeah, we can't forget Danny Smith, either. Danny Smith, you say? Sure. OK, not all of Central Catholic's great quarterbacks of the past end up in NFL uniforms. Some of them, like Smith, who was a very good defensive back at Edinboro (Pa.) State, wind up on the sideline.\nSmith is now in his 10th season as an NFL assistant, currently serving as special teams coach of the \n, the fourth franchise with which he has worked. Being an assistant in the league, and particularly a special teams coach, is an itinerant existence. But Smith is an outstanding coach, not to mention a really good guy, and his unit certainly played a big part in the Redskins' win at Ford Field on Sunday afternoon.\nLet's start with punter \n, who averaged 47.9 yards gross and 45.6 net yards on nine kicks. The veteran punter had five kicks inside the Detroit 20-yard line, and no touchbacks. The man who downed three of those punts near the Detroit goalline was \n, who also had two punt returns for 46 yards and a 20-yard kickoff return. \n blocked a punt that was returned 13 yards for a touchdown by \n.\nThe Redskins aren't likely to go to the playoffs in 2004, but rest assured, when they do return to postseason play in the next year or two, Danny Smith's kicking units will play a huge role. Defensive coordinator Gregg Williams has done a superb job, as noted here several times in the past, for Joe Gibbs. One contribution he made that goes mostly unnoticed is recommending Smith, who worked for him when he was the head coach in Buffalo for three seasons.\nCoaching hot seat\n\nBy the time this edition of \"The Morning After\" appears on the site, the NFL could have its first coaching victim of the season. And if the ax falls in Miami, the suspicion here is that no one will be more relieved than Dave Wannstedt. In fact, owner Wayne Huizenga might actually be doing Wannstedt a favor if he ends the suffering now.\nA couple weeks ago, during a chat session, someone asked why we are such apologists for Wannstedt. Well, if we've crossed the line in that regard, we apologize. It's just that Wannstedt is a good guy, one of the nicest people you'll meet, and much of the mess of this season was beyond his control.\nThat certainly isn't to suggest Wannstedt has been blameless during his Dolphins tenure. No way. But things began unraveling when \n bolted in July, and the tapestry is now just about bare.\nMiami has its bye this week, a convenient matter of timing for Huizenga, if he opts to make a change.\nAnother head coach with Western Pennsylvania roots, Jim Haslett of New Orleans, is back on the hot seat again, as well, following Sunday's abysmal performance in San Diego. His team seemed to at least temporarily save his job two weeks ago, heading into its bye, with a win at Oakland. But whatever progress the Saints demonstrated in that Oct. 31 victory evaporated with the pasting they took at the hands of the Chargers. Maybe, given the timing, owner Tom Benson retains Haslett through the rest of the season. It's hard to imagine now that the coach will be back in 2005.\nPunts\n\nArizona ended a 17-game road losing streak Sunday at Miami. The win was the franchise's first away from home since Oct. 6, 2002. ... After 10 years, NFL coaches seem finally to have grown comfortable with how to use the two-point conversion. From 1994-2003, coaches typically butchered the two-pointer. But this year, teams have converted 20 of 39 two-point tries, and that 51.3 percent success rate is the best of all-time. It tops the 47.9 percent rate of 2002 and the 47.8 percent mark of 1996. Of course, there's still a half-season remaining, and coaches could well slide again on their use of the two-point conversion. ... Some strange, but not all that surprising, tap-dancing going on at the NFL Players Association over the mammoth contract extension that \n left offensive tackle \n signed two weeks ago. The union contends it was a six-year extension, even though Ogden's former deal ran through 2006, and this one takes him through 2010. If it's a six-year extension, in the strictest terms, it would go through 2012. But the NFLPA has told agents that the '05 and '06 seasons in the past deal were strictly for salary cap proration purposes. Yeah, but that doesn't mean those years simply disappeared. ... The \n have now had five interceptions returned for touchdowns against them. ... \n officials will be holding their breath on Monday when defensive end \n has an MRI exam on his chest. Strahan suffered a pectoral injury in Sunday's loss to the Bears and, if there is a significant tear, he could miss the rest of the season. ... Kansas City backup tailback and 2003 first-round pick \n finally got playing time Sunday but rushed for just 21 yards on 10 carries. There was no explanation from the Chiefs as to why \n exited the game. ... Tampa Bay quarterback \n took another step toward reviving his career with a strong outing in the Bucs' win over the Chiefs. If he can continue at this level, the Bucs, who plan to start \n in 2005, may have to re-think that strategy. Griese's contract is structured in such a way that the Bucs probably will have to release him after the season. They might be wise to approach him about a deal that keeps him around. ... Chicago tailback \n, subbing for the injured \n, had another solid outing Sunday, rushing for 110 yards. In the nearly two full games in which he has replaced Jones, the former league rookie of the year has rushed for 208 yards. Thomas is certainly auditioning for the future because he is eligible for unrestricted free agency in the spring. A team that needs a solid No. 2 tailback could do a lot worse. ... The Philadelphia offense, which has sputtered more than people seem to realize lately, failed to convert any of its third-down situations on Sunday. The Eagles are just 12-for-54 on third down over the last five outings. ... Bills tailback \n now has three 100-yard performances in the past four weeks. Since replacing \n as the top option in the Buffalo running game, he has carried 109 times for 403 yards. His 37 carries on Sunday tied for the second most in franchise history.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&page=/morning/week9"},

{"title": "The band plays on", "text": "\nBALTIMORE -- Heading home from his tryout that snowy March night, David Ciofalo was beaming. His family had just moved from New Jersey and here he was, at 17, the newest member of the Baltimore Colts' marching band.\nCarrying his new snare drum, he walked in the house, bragged to his dad, turned on the nightly news and crumbled. Mayflower moving vans lined up at the Colts' practice facility.\nThe same day it began, his dream had ended.\n\"It was like I had just won a new car,\" Ciofalo said, \"and then they were like, 'Oh no, sorry, there's been a technicality. We had to draw again. It's not you.' \"\nHe got off easy. For most of Baltimore, Robert Irsay's whimsical decision to move the team to Indianapolis in the middle of that March night, taking everything Colts with him, was like jamming a steak knife through their hearts, creating an unbearable pain that would take decades to heal.\nBut John Ziemann believed he had just the right antidote -- music. When the Colts left the band uniforms behind -- they just happened to be at the cleaners that fateful day -- Ziemann tracked them down, re-energized his group and kept the band together.\nLater that fateful night, his first night in the band, Ciofalo called Ziemann and asked what he should do with his new drum. Ziemann told him.\n\"Bring it to rehearsal next Wednesday.\"\nFast forward 20 years and there's Ciofalo again, standing on the 50-yard line at M&T Bank Stadium beaming, a snare drum wrapped around his waist. And there's Ziemann, in his trademark purple blazer, pacing up and down the sideline like Bear Bryant during the fourth quarter of the Sugar Bowl.\nThe Baltimore Ravens are about to take the field against the Cleveland Browns, but not before the largest marching band in the NFL performs the Ravens' fight song and marches to spell out \"Ravens\" in script. One of just four NFL marching bands, it is a rarity in the era of deafening, piped-in, the-louder-the-better stadium music. But it's what this band stands for that means most.\nWhen everything else Colts left Baltimore behind -- \"all the way down to cutting the phone lines,\" Ziemann said -- the all-volunteer band stayed. It played at pep rallies, parades and private concerts. It played on the steps of Maryland's statehouse and at opposing NFL stadiums. And band members sold everything from frozen pizzas and M&Ms to textbooks to help stay afloat.\n\"The fans needed something. The band needing something. I needed something,\" Ziemann, the band's president, said. \"And I was bound and determined not to let this thing die. No damn way was that going to happen. Not under my watch.\"\nToday, the Colts Marching Band has become Baltimore's Marching Ravens. It is made up of more than 250 performers ranging in age from 14 to 63, the ranks including doctors, lawyers, nurses, secretaries, bank presidents and housewives. Even a street vendor marches. But it's Ziemann, his wife Charlene and Ciofalo who have the stories to tell. They are the ones who were there that gut-wrenching night, and they are the ones who are still there today.\nZiemann likes to tell the story of the day he called the dry cleaners, asking if he could pick up the uniforms the Colts left behind.\n\"They told me they couldn't give them to me,\" Ziemann said, \"but that they were outside in the back of their truck. And if I wanted to take their truck for a walk that night, that was fine by them.\"\nSo, in the middle of the night, Ziemann and a handful of band members went to the cleaners, picked up the truck and delivered the uniforms to the attic of a plumbing shop, where one of the band members worked. Two weeks later, they moved them again, hiding them in a mausoleum. Two weeks after that, the uniforms found their way into Ziemann's basement.\nAfter band members consulted with a lawyer, the uniforms reappeared a month after the team left, showing up at the first pep rally to bring football back to Baltimore.\nThe results were deafening.\n\"Usually, as a drummer, you can't hear a thing. Just the beat of the drum,\" Ciofalo said. \"But when we'd put those Colts uniforms on and perform back then, you knew they were raising the room because you could hear them. They drowned out the drums. That doesn't happen.\"\nIn 1996, when Ravens owner Art Modell -- one of the handful of NFL owners who invited the Colts' band to play in Cleveland -- brought the Ravens to Baltimore, he insisted that the old band be a part of it. Today, it's one of the only visible connections from Baltimore's football present to Baltimore's football past. Late Sunday night, when Ed Reed returned an interception an NFL record 105 yards, clinching a 27-13 Baltimore victory, one couldn't help but think that, in a small way, Ziemann had a hand in making it happen.\nSeventeen years earlier, when both the Maryland house and senate criticized then-Gov. William David Schaefer for seeking stadium financing for a team that didn't exist, Ziemann took his band to the statehouse steps and played the Colts' fight song.\n\"The governor didn't know we were coming,\" Ziemann said. \"He had a tear in his eye. A lot of people did.\"\nThe next Friday, the legislature approved a financing authority to build two new stadiums -- one for the Orioles and one for a football team.\n\"The Colts' marching band made the difference and turned the tide in winning the vote for the new stadium complex,\" Schaeffer said at the time. \"This wouldn't have happened without them.\"\nThe never-sit-still Ziemann, the guy who joined the band 42 years ago and still can't eat on game days, said he's never taken the time to sit back and soak up all that his group has accomplished. \"Too much to do,\" Ziemann said. But Ciofalo has. It hits him every time he stands on the 50-yard-line, drum around his waist, sticks by his side, waiting for the performance to begin. This is when he realizes how close this came to almost never happening. This is when he thinks about stealing band uniforms, selling pizzas, peddling books, doing everything imaginable to stay together.\n\"Our visibility at each NFL game we went to, the parades we played in, it was paramount,\" Ciofalo said. \"That was this city's way of saying, 'Hello, NFL, we're right here in the middle of your stadium and everybody loves us! Give us a team!' \"\nEventually, they did. And on Wednesday, when the band gets together for its weekly practice sessions -- just like it did on March 29, 1984 -- the transformation will be complete.\nThe Ravens just moved into a new, $31 million, 200,000-square-foot training complex, and team owner Steve Bisciotti invited Baltimore's Marching Ravens to practice there.\n\"We finally have a home,\" Ziemann said. \"It took 57 years, but we finally have a home. No more shoveling fields, no more tiny band rooms. We finally have a home.\"\nThey've more than earned it.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/ncf/footballinamerica/news/story?id=1918349"},

Parcells said he could sense during warmups that they weren't ready.\n\"It looked like we had looked at the film on Cincinnati and decided how hard we had to play and it was a misjudgment,\" Parcells said. \"To be lethargic in a game like that means they don't understand the situation, they don't understand the opportunity. They don't understand what the league is about, how this season is unfolding and where we are.\"\nThe Bengals played down to Dallas' low expectations, leading only 9-3 at halftime despite recovering three turnovers. The Cowboys opened the second half knowing they were lucky to be within a touchdown of the lead and reached the Cincinnati 23 on their\n\nfirst drive.\nThen came consecutive penalties on third down, pushing Dallas out of field-goal range. The defense gave up a 76-yard touchdown pass on the ensuing drive and the game was essentially over.\n\"We self-destructed,\" Parcells said.\nAmong the exasperating examples Parcells listed were plays that had been worked on repeatedly in practice. Some of them are basic football, too, such as how to down a punt.\n\"That kind of thing just doesn't seem to get through to them,\" he said.\nIt doesn't help that many of the breakdowns are coming from players who should know better, such as those ill-timed penalties called on \n (false start) and \n (intentional grounding). Testaverde also threw three interceptions, lost a fumble and was stopped on fourth-and-inches at the Cincinnati 22 on the game-opening drive.\nTestaverde said several of his turnovers came while trying to force things to happen. For instance, the picks all came on balls intended for \n, the only healthy veteran receiver.\nTestaverde also blamed himself for the team being so emotionally flat.\n\"It's my job when I see that to get them going,\" he said. \"I did a poor job of that.\"\nSafety \n said he was upset that even when something good happened, the team couldn't sustain any momentum.\n\"When we make plays, we're excited, then we fall back into work mode,\" Williams said. \"It should be fun. Right now, we're not having fun on the field.\"\nDespite it all, Parcells is not ready to give up on this season. That means he's sticking with Testaverde and not turning to backup \n, the former Michigan star who spent the last three years playing baseball in the \n organization.\n\"Why would you at this point in time take an unproven guy ... and throw him into this?\" he said. \"Only foolish people would ask the question right now.\"\nParcells was also dismissive of owner Jerry Jones' postgame comment that the two of them would be discussing personnel changes.\n\"Jerry's not making the personnel changes,\" he said. \"I am.\"\nParcells added not to expect many.\n\"The options,\" he said, \"are not available.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1918848"},

{"title": "Freeney finishes with 3 tackles, 2 sacks", "text": "\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Maybe it's true, as the old adage suggests, that the best revenge is living well.\nJust don't try convincing \n standout defensive end \n that \n well, especially in a one-on-one battle against an opponent who basically made his reputation against you in a matchup years ago, isn't so much sweeter.\nIn a Monday night game that featured about as much offensive weaponry, and only a touch of defensive play-making, as was expected from two of the NFL's highest-octane units, it was the dominance of Freeney against \n left offensive tackle \n that helped separate the teams in a 31-28 Colts victory.\nNo doubt most of the headlines will center, and justifiably so, around Colts quarterback \n. The NFL's reigning co-most valuable player, and certainly a candidate to repeat that accomplishment, Manning threw four touchdown passes and also led the Indianapolis offense 55 yards late in the game to set up \n's winning 35-yard field goal with two seconds remaining in the bitterly contested showdown.\nBut if it was Vanderjagt's kick that determined the outcome, Freeney got an opportunity to settle an old score, and the three-year veteran succeeded in brilliant fashion.\n\"The fact that it was a Monday night game, yeah, that will get the adrenaline going a little bit,\" said Freeney, who finished with three tackles, two sacks and more than a handful of hurries, as he harassed Vikings quarterback \n all night. \"And the fact that it was (McKinnie) on the other side of the line, that meant something, too.\"\nIt is a coupling that goes back to the 2001 college season, when Freeney registered 17¬Ω sacks in his senior year at Syracuse but was blanked by McKinnie, then the anchor of the University of Miami offensive line. The Miami propaganda machine, which conveniently overlooked that McKinnie had considerable double-team assistance in the game, used the performance by its giant tackle to hype him for postseason honors.\nThe contention that he was manhandled by McKinnie stuck in Freeney's craw for the better part of 2¬Ω seasons.\nOr, to be more precise, until Monday night.\n\"Did we remind him of it?\" asked Colts defensive tackle \n. \"Uh, yeah, you might say that, I guess.\"\nTruth be told, there was no need to needle Freeney, whose memory is elephantine. Ask the Colts' 2002 first-round draft pick about the 28 sacks he had collected in his 38 appearances prior to Monday night, and there is a pretty good chance he can detail every one of them -- who he beat, the move he employed to burst into the backfield. Certainly he will file away the two knockdowns of Culpepper here on Monday night and might even mentally frame them, given the blocker he abused on the plays.\nHis two sacks, the only times the sturdy Culpepper went down in 21 \"dropbacks,\" really demonstrated the manner in which Freeney has made himself a complete pass rusher. Once simply an upfield \"edge\" rusher, whose game lacked versatility as he simply tried to beat every offensive tackle with his quickness, Freeney has added some nifty tricks to his repertoire now.\nThe first sack, which came in the second quarter, was a classic speed-rush, with Freeney roaring around McKinnie while the Minnesota tackle was still in his stance, dumping an unsuspecting Culpepper for a 7-yard loss. In the third quarter, Freeney broke out one of his new moves, spinning inside and then cutting through the clutter in the middle of the pocket to nab Culpepper for an 8-yard sack. Of his unofficial half-dozen pressures, three came on inside countermaneuvers.\nIn a rare subpar performance, McKinnie, who some now regard as the best left tackle in the NFC, was also flagged for a false-start penalty. In the second quarter, with Freeney dominating the action, the Vikings staff was forced to provide McKinnie some help, as Minnesota began to double-team and \"chip\" him.\nMuch of the double-team adjustment, though, was to little avail.\n\"One of the things I've learned is that you've got to get better every year, add some new twist, improve at some (facet) of the game,\" Freeney said. \"I mean, those other guys are getting paid, too, you know? The tackles, they're getting bigger, getting quicker. If you don't keep up, you'll be in trouble. My thing tonight was to force the big man to have to keep moving his feet. Go outside a little. Go inside on him. Make him work. It's like going up against Goliath -- that guy is so big, but sometimes David wins a few, too.\"\nFreeney, 24, isn't as small as dimensions listed on the roster make him appear. Although he is only 6-1, undersized by NFL defensive end standards, Freeney is thicker and more stout than his alleged weight of 268 pounds. He plays with natural leverage, high energy and, as manifested on Monday night, with a purpose.\nAnd for a young player, Freeney is the rare student of the game, poring over videotape in an effort to gain an edge and frequently consulting with fellow defensive ends around the league. Among the big-time pass rushers also represented by his agent, Gary Wichard, are \n of Miami, Baltimore's \n and New Orleans' \n. The group has formed an unofficial fraternity, updating its information on pass-blockers and sharing tricks of the trade.\nTwenty minutes or so after exorcising a demon from his past, Freeney tried hard to share the credit for his clutch performance, but his teammates would have none of it. Playing way outside, sometimes in a \"nine\" technique, Freeney ran rings around McKinnie, and the Colts defenders were appreciative of his wire-to-wire effort.\n\"He wanted this game bad,\" Reagor said. \"There was something personal at stake here for him and he went out and erased all that (bad) history.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1918927"},
{"title": "Bates faces difficult situation", "text": "\nGood man, Jim Bates, who we got to know very well when he was defensive coordinator for the \n in 1994.\nNot good enough, though, to rescue this Titanic of a season for the \n. But then again, owner Wayne Huizenga could have summoned the ghosts of Vince Lombardi, George Halas and Tom Landry on Monday evening, after Dave Wannstedt had put himself out of his misery by resigning, and it wouldn't make any difference for 2004.\nIn fact, nothing, not even Bates working 18-hour days (which he probably will), can clean up this mess. Huizenga, who made his fortune in waste disposal and understands a thing or two about scrap heaps and landfills and the stench of wretched refuse, certainly knows there is nothing to be salvaged from this train wreck of a season.\nOur guess \n is that none of that will matter to Bates, whose basic pragmatism is likely to be overshadowed by his own pride, and the belief he might be able to at least get the ship pointed in the right direction for whatever big-name coach inherits the dawdling Dolphins in 2005.\nIt is, of course, a thankless role into which Bates has stepped. But then Bates isn't one of those guys who needs a slap on the back or a hearty \n to motivate him. He will put his head down and forge ahead, make whatever personnel and schematic changes he deems reasonable and try to straighten up the mess as much as possible, so that his successor doesn't walk into a completely unkempt and untenable situation.\nOur guess is, too, that Bates will be somewhat flexible in listening to ideas, not only from his assistants but also his players. How do we know that? Because we have watched Jim Bates mature from an intractable coach, one who was dead certain that the unusual 5-2 scheme he installed with the Falcons in 1994 would work, to a guy who underwent a metamorphosis of sorts when the college-style defense failed miserably.\nA decade later, that 5-2 scheme is barely an entry in the Bates memory banks. There are some detractors who strongly suggest that Bates, a 4-3 guy now, has played things a bit too safe during his Miami tenure. That the \"shell\" secondary coverages to which the club often resorts, even in those seasons when the Dolphins openly declared they had the best single-coverage cornerbacks in the league, lack creativity. That the results have not quite risen to the talent level on-hand.\nSome of those criticisms might be justifiable. But at the end of this season, when he takes his leave of the Dolphins, the bet here is that no one will criticize Bates for not trying to tidy up the organization for the next full-time head coach. Even that task, league history indicates, won't be easy.\nIn becoming the first interim coach in the NFL since Wade Phillips replaced Dan Reeves for the final three games with the Falcons in 2003, Bates is the 11th in-season replacement in the past decade. He is also the 55th in-season replacement since the 1970 merger, and the track record is reflective of just what a thankless role he has accepted.\nJust 10 of the replacement coaches carved out winning records, and that includes four who coached in three games or less. Of the 26 who inherited a team with at least seven games remaining in a season, just five finished with winning marks. The cumulative record for the 54 replacement coaches is 110-242-1, a microscopic winning mark of .313.\nNone of those numbers will matter, of course, to Bates. A head coach again for the first time since he ran the San Antonio Gunslingers of the USFL in 1984-85, he will do what all coaches do, and that is to try to win the next game on the schedule. Hopefully, Bates can notch a victory or two before the year runs out. And, if he does, hopefully some folks will be paying attention.\nLast time we checked, the folks at the University of Florida were looking for a new head coach, and Bates has some Gators ties, having once served as defensive coordinator there. The whispers from people I talk to in Gainesville are that the Bates name doesn't have the kind of cache the school needs. But if Bates wins some games with the rag-tag outfit over which he suddenly presides, athletic director Jeremy Foley could do much worse than to consider him a candidate.\nA good guy thrown into such a morass of a situation, Bates isn't likely to want anyone to feel sorry for him, but he will need a job in a couple of months.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1919310"},

{"title": "Playing catch-up with the future", "text": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Every day they wait on \n here, the pressure percolates. Behind a crumbling offensive line and a suddenly tenuous season, there will be less and less patience for the NFL's No. 1 pick. It won't be long until he's on his way into the Giants huddle, where Manning will be reduced to proving he has a little Roethlisberger within his perfectly pedigreed self.\n\"I'm proud of Ben,\" Manning says.\nYes, Eli Manning must be very proud of \n, the way \n is proud of \n, the way \n felt so good for Eli's big brother, Peyton. Proud perhaps, but wishing it weren't so, absolutely. As if there weren't enough pressure on Manning to be a star with these Giants, now he needs to be the hardest thing for a young quarterback in the NFL: a star sooner rather than later.\nFor everything a Manning has to live up to with his family name, Roethlisberger is the comparison no one expected on draft day. He is chasing the NFL MVP award and the Super Bowl, chasing greatness, the way Ernie Accorsi had counted on Manning to chase it for the Giants. Nevertheless, the pressure always was going to be intense for Manning. First of all, he's a Manning. What's more, he muscled his way out of San Diego to land in New York.\nBut before he ever starts a game in the NFL, he's fallen far behind Roethlisberger.\n\"I'm not frustrated with (sitting),\" Manning insists. \"I've sat before in college, and done this whole thing. I don't think it's a waste. If you just look at a lot of other players in the league who have sat and watched, it shows that it can be a benefit in a young player's career.\"\nFrom his heritage, there's no way a Manning believes sitting is the best. They're conditioned to be stars. They're used to having it be all about them. And there's nothing wrong with that, nothing at all. Who wouldn't want their franchise quarterback to feel that way? Here's the bottom line: There's no way Manning will consider this season anything but a waste unless he gets into the middle of it for the Giants. More than that, he has to make up for lost time, make up for the headstart given to the 11th pick who has started before him.\nAnd it won't be long until Manning is the Giants starter, until the used quarterback warranty has run out on Warner. Manning won't begin the game Sunday in Arizona, but he has a fighting chance to finish it. No one was ever sure how far the Giants could get with Warner, and yes, a 4-1 start exceeded everyone's expectations.\nNow they've lost two out of the past three games, including devastating Giants Stadium defeats to Detroit and Chicago when Warner played lousy. Warner has been sacked 18 times in the past three games, and turned the ball over four times on Sunday against the Bears.\nThe end is near for Warner here. Whatever he wants to believe, it was always one bad game away. This was never a fair fight.\n\"Everybody had been waiting for this from Day 1,\" Warner says. \"You can have one game that's not up to par and all of a sudden that talk starts. I don't know too many places around the league where that situation would occur.\"\nForgive Warner for getting smacked so often these past few seasons that he's forgotten he's a shell of his old self, that this was never about him with the Giants. This is about the kid. This is about the No. 1 pick. Yes, everyone has been waiting for Manning in New York. Beyond Manning himself, the pressure might be most palpable for the Giants general manager responsible for bringing him to town.\nAccorsi traded the world to get the No. 1 pick and select Manning. The Giants could've stayed at No. 4, kept the 2005 top pick and had Roethlisberger. Close to retirement, Accorsi is obsessed with his legacy and desperate to get himself connected to a superstar passer for the ages. He drafted John Elway No. 1 in 1982, but his owner traded him to the Broncos out of fear Elway would never sign with the \n.\nAn old assistant to Pete Rozelle, Accorsi is steeped in the history of the National Football League. He wants to be a bigger part of the history himself, and Manning promised to be that ticket. And maybe Manning will be that quarterback for the Giants.\nFor now, the question looms over everything: Did the Giants get the right man?\n\"I've got to worry about myself,\" Manning says. \"Each week, I'm learning more. The more I practice, more I learn about defenses and what different teams do, I'm going to be more comfortable and more prepared when I do get in.\"\nWhen he does get into the Giants lineup, it won't be easy. \n is gone for the season on defense, the offensive line is breaking down and yet they'll be turning to the No. 1 pick to get the Giants to the playoffs. Roethlisberger brings the Steelers to Giants Stadium on Dec. 18, and when it happens, Manning will have been on the job for a few weeks. It won't be easy.\nAll his life, everyone wanted him to chase his father and big brother.

When it comes to major trades/free-agent signings involving wideouts, teams usually end up having overpaid for them. \n. Alvin Harper. Yancy Thigpen. \n. \n. \n. \n just got to Atlanta and hasn't had \n to work with all the time, and \n has been OK for Washington, but has either been worth the money and draft picks they cost the Falcons and Redskins, respectively? It's debatable.\nThere are several factors involved in the success of a receiver: system, quarterback, other receiver(s). Most of the time the top available receivers are \"No. 2\" types whose old teams wouldn't pay them what they wanted. Other teams think they can be No. 1s and pay them as such. It's difficult for them to enjoy the same kind of production in a different system, without a top-notch quarterback, and without, say, a Michael Irvin or an \n dealing with the double coverage.\nOwens was a different case. He's a true No. 1 still in the prime of his career. He went from a good quarterback in \n to a great one in McNabb. And the Eagles offense is another variation of the West Coast scheme, which he played in for eight seasons in San Francisco.\nOwens has been worth every cent of the $10 million bonus included in the seven-year, $42-million deal the Eagles gave him after completing the trade with the 49ers and Ravens, one that also cost them defensive end \n and a fifth-round pick next year. With his next touchdown reception, he'll have twice as many as Philly's receivers had all of last year.\nIt says a lot about what exceptional talents McNabb and Owens are that they needed very little time to adjust to each other. Owens went to Philly and immediately became McNabb's go-to guy. Head coach Andy Reid and offensive coordinator Brad Childress also deserve credit for coming up with creative ways to get Owens the football despite his being the focus of opposing defenses.\nOwens' 49 catches and 750 yards rank fifth and second in the league, respectively. He's ruffled a few feathers around the league and among media, but he's fit in nicely with the rest of the Birds. They seem to love him in Philly's locker room.\nIf Owens and the Eagles keep it up\n, he'll get serious MVP consideration.\n\"To say we expected this production, we can't honestly say that,\" said team vice president of player personnel Tom Heckert. \"We knew he was a good player. It was up to us to put him in position to make the plays we know he's capable of.\"\nOther offseason acquisitions that have yielded immediate returns (not including rookies):\n When he arrived via trade with the Bengals, Dillon, a malcontent in Cincinnati, tried to downplay the significance of his addition, reminding everyone that the Patriots had won two titles without him. However, they wouldn't be 7-1 without him. He's New England's first-half MVP; look to the Pittsburgh game two weeks ago for proof. Dillon was sidelined and as a result, New England's running attack was shut down as the team lost its first game this season. With the Patriots' passing game sputtering since Week 2, Dillon has picked up the slack, gaining at least 100 yards in his last three games and four times overall. He's averaging almost five yards a carry and is eighth in the league with 749 yards. Above all, like Owens, he's been a model teammate.\n \n has been dynamic, but the biggest reason the Steelers are 7-1 and considered the league's best team is their running game. The Steelers have returned to the run after finishing 31st in rushing last year, and Staley is their featured back. The former Eagle, who signed for a reported $14 million over five years, including $4 million in bonuses, gained 707 yards in Pittsburgh's first seven games before missing last Sunday's win over Philly with a hamstring injury. He's still 10th in the league in rushing and averages 4.7 yards a carry. Staley and \n form a devastating tailback duo, with Bettis (eight touchdowns) getting most of the work in the red zone.\n He's kept \n's seat warm and helped keep the surprising Giants (5-3) in the playoff hunt. Warner, who signed what is essentially a one-year deal, hasn't put up St. Louis-type stats (62.6 percent, five touchdowns, four picks) but he led New York to four wins in its first five games.\n Collectively they cost owner Dan Snyder $25 million in bonuses. So far, money well spent. Washington has the league's top defense. The \"D\" is the only reason the Redskins' season is merely disappointing and not disastrous. Cornerback Springs ($10 million) has three sacks and three interceptions, defensive tackle Griffin ($8 million bonus) leads the team with four sacks, and linebacker Washington ($7 million) is second on the team with 53 tackles. Springs and Washington are playing like Pro Bowlers.\n Given yet another chance to salvage his career, Griese has helped Tampa Bay save its once-lost season with three wins in four starts. Griese replaced an injured \n Oct. 10 against New Orleans, after Simms started in place of an ineffective \n. Griese, who signed a three-year deal in March, has sparked Tampa Bay's offense by completing 69 percent with six touchdowns and just one interception. He's fourth in the league with a quarterback rating is 106.9. Jon Gruden has his quarterback. Then again, so did Mike Shanahan.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=smith_michael&id=1919849"},

The former Oakland Raider has been practicing with the team in recent weeks.\n\"Like I told Osi last night, in the event that me and Stray are out, it's the young guys, they have to step forward,\" said Washington, who tore an anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.\nStrahan has not missed a game since sitting out against Dallas late in the 1995 season with a hamstring injury. He has played in 137 straight regular-season games, starting 136, including the last 95. The only missed start was midway through the 1998 season when back spasms prevented him from starting against Dallas, although he played much of the game.\nStrahan has also started five playoffs games in that span. His 175 career games with the Giants is sixth in franchise history.\nA 1993 second-round draft pick out of Texas Southern, Strahan leads all active NFL players with 118 sacks, which is 12th all-time. He had four sacks this season, including one against \n of the Bears for a 14-yard loss Sunday.\nStrahan won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in 2001 with a single-season record 22¬Ω sacks, breaking Mark Gastineau's record of 22 in 1984 with the \n.\nStrahan, who will be 33 in two weeks, led the NFL with 18¬Ω sacks last season.\nWhile a star, he has never taken the easy route. He has been a tireless worker on the field, in the weight room and in the video room, where he studies opponents and fellow defensive ends, looking for things to add to his repertoire.\n\"I'm afraid to fail,\" Strahan said in an interview with The Associated Press in October. \"I think at one point, when you get to a certain level that you expect of yourself and everyone expects of you, you can't take a break.\n\"If you do, your game drops off, and it's noticed easier than if you are trying to build a career.

{"title": "Deep receiver class paying dividends", "text": "\nQuarterback \n became a regular fixture in the offense much faster than the Steelers anticipated. And two months into the season, it's working out just fine.\nThe Miami (Ohio) alumnus, ESPN analysts Sean Salisbury and \n first-half MVP, was the obvious choice at quarterback for Rookie Report's midseason team. Roethlisberger, coming off of wins over previously unbeaten New England and Philadelphia, has become the first rookie to start his career 6-0 since Pittsburgh's Mike Kruczek did so in 1976.\n\"He's remarkable,\" Eagles linebacker \n said. \"Look at him on the field and he doesn't look like a rookie, he looks like a guy who's been around four or five years.\"\nAside from his first appearance against Baltimore in which he replaced injured starter \n, Roethlisberger (1,316 yards, 11 touchdowns) has been in total control. He's first in the AFC in completion percentage (69.0), third in passer rating (105.2) and sixth in touchdowns (11). He's thrown just five interceptions this season, two coming against the Ravens and another on the first play from scrimmage in his first start at Miami.\n\"I try not to get overwhelmed with it, and I try not to get overexcited,\" Roethlisberger said in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \"because I don't want it to take over what I am feeling and the emotions, so I try to keep calm and levelheaded.\"\nMinnesota's \n (64 carries, 376 yards) hasn't had the impact over a prolonged stretch like Roethlisberger, but his performance in October made him an easy choice at running back. The Vikings, proving just how deep they were at tailback, turned to Moore when \n and \n were unavailable against the Texans. Moore gained 182 total yards in that contest and accumulated similar numbers over the next two games.\n\"I don't know what to say. Humbly speaking, I've been doing this for years,\" Moore said after the win over New Orleans. \"I'm just doing my job.\"\nAlso getting the job done league wide are first-year receivers. Ten wideouts were taken in the first two rounds of the draft and several have made early contributions. In fact, because of the depth at wideout and the thin crop of tight ends (partly because of injuries suffered by \n, Benjamin Watson and \n) we're pulling a Mike Martz and running a four-receiver set.\nDetroit's \n was a no-brainer for the team despite being less productive than any of the other three wideouts selected. Williams, who has been a non-factor or no show in four of the past five games because of an ankle injury, has been a one-man highlight reel at times while leading the Lions with 27 catches, 395 yards and five touchdowns.\nStatistically, the most impressive receiver has been Tampa Bay's \n, elevated to the starting lineup when injuries sidelined \n, \n and \n. Clayton, with at least four receptions in all but one game this year, is sixth in the NFC with 595 yards.\nFellow first-rounder \n has yet to post a 100-yard game, but has been relatively consistent for the Cardinals. He had a 48-yard grab down to Miami's 3-yard line to set up his two-yard scoring reception for the game-deciding touchdown in Sunday's win over the Dolphins.\nOur fourth receiver, \n (453 yards, two touchdowns), has also gained more playing time in large part because of injuries. The USC alumnus has compensated for some of the big plays Carolina lost when \n suffered a season-ending injury in the opener. Nineteen of Colbert's 27 catches have gone for first downs.\nCompleting the offense is the line: tackles \n (Oakland) and \n (Minnesota); guards \n (N.Y. Giants) and \n (Tennessee); and center \n (Arizona).\nOn the other side of the ball, there are some strong candidates up the middle. \n (21 tackles, one sack) has helped the Patriots deal with the free-agency departure of \n and \n (21 tackles, two sacks) has been impressive for the Cardinals. However, the two defensive tackles earning spots on our team are Chicago's \n and San Diego's \n.\nThe Bears' defense, despite a struggling offense that generally doesn't win the time of possession battle, is ranked ninth overall. Harris, figured to play a bigger role in stopping the run, has also gotten after the quarterback -- collecting 3¬Ω sacks to go with his 27 tackles.\nConversely, San Diego's defense has been helped by an offense that's scoring a lot of points and forcing opponents to shy away from running the ball. The Chargers are allowing just 81 yards a game on the ground and Olshansky has been a factor, recording 27 tackles and one sack.\nRounding out the defensive line are New Orleans' \n (17 tackles and two sacks)  and Minnesota's \n (18 tackles and three sacks).\nOur group of linebackers is led by a pair of former college teammates who have picked up where they left off. Miami alumni \n (51 tackles) and \n (53 tackles) are among their teams' leading tacklers and factor in mightily to the Jets and Broncos, respectively, being ranked top 6 defensively in the AFC. Our third 'backer is Detroit's \n (45 tackles, second on team), who's had to emerge following the serious injury to \n.\nIn the secondary, there were a lot of strong candidates at safety. First-rounder \n (Washington), former linebacker \n (Seattle) and \n (Cincinnati), who has played both safety spots in addition to cornerback, have made some big plays for their respective clubs. But they haven't had the impact of Big Apple defensive backs \n and \n.\nWilson, who was inactive for the season opener against the Eagles, took over as the Giants starting strong safety when veteran \n suffered a season-ending left knee injury on Sept. 24. Since then, Wilson, a fifth-rounder from Tennessee, has emerged as a consistent playmaker. He leads the team with 48 tackles, three interceptions and also has five pass deflections and three sacks.\n\"I told them, if you get him into camp, you're gonna have a hard time ever cutting him,\" Tennessee secondary coach Larry Slade was quoted as saying before the NFL draft.\nThough Coleman has played from Day 1, the circumstances leading to his role as starter are similar to Wilson's. The fifth-rounder from Washington State, taken seven picks after Wilson, was thrust into the starting lineup after \n suffered a groin injury. Coleman had a game-saving interception in the season opener against Cincinnati and has been a fixture in the secondary. He's third on the team in tackles (44), first in pass deflections (seven) and also has a pair of picks.\nJoining the New Yorkers in the secondary are Chicago's \n and Houston's \n.\nVasher (three  interceptions, five pass deflections) could have made the team based almost solely on his outing against the Giants on Sunday. Not only did \"The Interceptor\" -- his college nickname which has been picked up by Bears coach Lovie Smith -- pick off \n in the first half, but he also batted away a pass to \n in the fourth quarter as the Giants attempted to rally.\nRobinson (35 tackles, three INTs, 10 pass deflections) had an equally impressive outing against the Raiders last month, recording his first two picks and also knocking down a pair of passes.\nThe impressive play among rookies hasn't been restricted to offense and defense.\nBaltimore's \n, who was undrafted, returned punts for touchdowns in consecutive games against the Chiefs and Redskins. He's second in the AFC with a 12.6 punt return average.\nSan Diego's \n is tied as the league's third-leading scorer (68), having converted all 32 of his PATs and 12 of his 13 field goals.

Now look around.\"\nLook around and you see some genuine atmosphere -- what you'd hope to see when your team is a playoff contender and \"Monday Night Football\" has come to town for the first time in four years.\nYou see RVs and campers in hordes. You see face paint and goofy horse-head hats -- and Manning jerseys on almost every man, woman and child. You see gonzo drinking and gluttonous eating -- and gratuitous smack-talking to the sizeable number of Minnesota invaders. (Another sign that the Colts aren't there yet: too many tickets going to people wearing purple. No way this happens in, say, Denver.)\nYou see a blue-and-white fire engine, tailgate headquarters of The Blue Crew, a 5-year-old fan group that has grown from 10 members to 516. If Blue Crew members go too long without a beer, they can be summoned by bullhorn to collect one.\n\"Tailgating almost was nonexistent,\" Blue Crew co-founder Randy Collins said. \"Now, you can't get here early enough.\"\nSome Colts fans from the Evansville area, in the southwest corner of the state about 2¬Ω hours away, arrived to tailgate 5 hours before kickoff -- the earliest they were allowed into the lot. On this Midwestern Monday night, the revelry was in high gear.\nBubba Hoffman was wearing a blue-and-white felt bowler on his head and a Manning jersey on his torso -- although his body was more along the lines of Gilbert Brown. He was cooking turkey legs with Big Dave Alben and Ken Fraley, who have had season tickets for all 21 years the Colts have been in Indy.\nAlben says he's missed only one home game in that time.\n\"He was in jail,\" Bubba offered. Alben looked hurt at this revelation but did not refute it. Instead, he offered his prediction on the Colts' game against the Vikings: 56-3.\n\"That's been our prediction for every game since 1984,\" he said. \"One time, we're going to be right.\"\nNot far away were some new (and young) season-ticket holders, seduced by the team's success and growing popularity. Their leading indicator that the Colts are the hot thing in town, according to one man: \"Look at all the beautiful women! No more corn-fed girls out here.\"\nThere was nothing beautiful about the Colts in Indy for many years. It took 12 seasons to win a playoff game. Sixteen seasons to win more than nine games and to host a playoff game. Twenty seasons to win a home playoff game and finally send the fans spilling out of the RCA Dome in a fit of ecstasy.\nUntil that time, look at the list of coaches: Frank Kush, Rod Dowhower, Ron Meyer, Rick Venturi ... finally, Ted Marchibroda got something done in the mid-90s with Captain Comeback, Jim Harbaugh.\nLook at the list of busted draft picks: Overall No. 1s\n Jeff George and Steve Emtman, plus other first-rounders like Leonard Coleman, Paul Bergmann and Sean Dawkins. (There's a reason why, for many years in the 1980s and early '90s, Indy radio stations played a popular song with the refrain, \"Help my Colts. Lord, help my Colts.\")\nAnd look at the fickle fan support: Indy's first-ever home playoff game, against Tennessee in 1999, turned into a near home game for the Titans as thousands of their fans drove north on I-65 and gobbled up tickets. The resulting roars for the Titans in an upset of the 13-3 Colts turned the game into a hometown embarrassment.\nThat's changed. Mostly.\n\"Some fans don't give a rat's ass about this team,\" young season-ticket holder Tony Abbott said. \"But the fans out here suffering in the cold care.\"\n(Meteorological note: Monday was a blue-sky sunny day in Indy, and temperatures never dipped toward anything punitive. A decent coat and long pants were enough to make tailgating tolerable -- and then everyone headed indoors. So on a scale of one to the Frozen Tundra -- well, you get the idea.)\nThe fact is, Hoosiers are wired to be indoors at this time of year anyway. They're used to basketball gyms.\nThis cannot be understated as an explanation for the slow catch-on of Colts football. The state that produced John Wooden, Larry Bird and Oscar Robertson, among a thousand others, has a much shorter list of homegrown football heroes (Rod Woodson, Bob Griese and Tom Harmon probably lead the pack). There simply isn't much gridiron heritage here to build upon.\nMany high schools in the state have no football teams. Meanwhile, the Indiana state high school basketball tournament has been a huge deal for nearly a century -- until the state high school athletic association drew a mustache on Mona Lisa, going from a legendary single-class tournament to multiple classes. (Fan interest correspondingly has plummeted.)\nBob Knight's forced exit has at least opened the athletic pantheon to Manning, Harrison and running back Edgerrin James -- although it must be noted that a dog was trotting around the tailgate lot in a Reggie Miller jersey, and several fans said they thought a Pacers NBA title or an Indiana University national basketball championship would be bigger than a Colts Super Bowl win.\nBut Manning and Harrison play well in a state of polite and folksy people. After all, they just elected a governor, Mitch Daniels, who ran on the slogan, \"My Man Mitch,\" and who spent weeks traveling the state in an RV and staying at peoples' houses.\nMost Hoosiers would be honored to show Peyton or Marvin to the guest room. Just don't ask them if they know who John Facenda is.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/ncf/footballinamerica/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id=1919078"},

Contract details were not available, but the deal is believed to be for one year at the league minimum of $760,000, prorated over the balance of the schedule.\nTampa Bay created a roster spot for Ahanotu by placing starting center \n on the injured reserve list. Wade, a seven-year veteran who started the first eight games in '04, suffered a season-ending knee injury in last week's victory against Kansas City.\nBy adding Ahanotu, a favorite in the community, the Bucs not only bolstered a defensive front significantly affected by injuries in recent weeks but also brought back a player who was once an integral part of a standout Tampa Bay front four.\nAhanotu can play end and tackle and, with the Bucs trying to deal with injuries to three lineman, is likely to quickly contribute some snaps at both positions. Two tackles, \n and \n, are already on injured reserve. Standout \"under\" tackle \n could miss this week's game with a shoulder injury. Last Sunday, undersized defensive end \n was forced to move inside.\nA sixth-round pick by Tampa Bay in the 1993 draft, Ahanotu earned a starting job with the Bucs as a rookie. He made 113 appearances with Tampa Bay, mostly at left end, before being released for salary cap considerations after the 2000 campaign. The best season of his career came with the Bucs in 1997, when he posted 65 tackles and added 10 sacks.\nIn addition to his Tampa Bay tenure, Ahanotu has played with St. Louis (2001), Buffalo (2002), San Francisco (2003) and Miami (2004). He appeared in five games for the Dolphins this season, and collected three tackles and a sack. Last season in 16 games as a backup in San Francisco, he had 27 tackles and four sacks.\nWhile he doesn't have the explosive first step he possessed earlier in his NFL career, Ahanotu is still a player who anchors well enough against the run and who retains some upfield pass-rush ability.\nHe has 420 tackles, 43 sacks, four forced fumbles and seven recoveries in his 166 games, including 135 starts.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1920114"},

Wannstedt accepted the blame and said he resigned because his job status had become a distraction.\n\"I have too much respect for the players and owner of this organization to allow myself to be the focal point for the remainder of the season,\" he said at a news conference. \"I told the players today the team must come first.

Now they're one defeat from their first losing\n\nseason since 1988 and the butt of jokes, with one wag renaming the\n\nteam's home Semi-Pro Player Stadium.\nWannstedt didn't mention Williams by name but said there were a\n\nlot of reasons for the Dolphins' decline.\n\"Many of those things I had no control over,\" he said. \"But\n\nthose things are not important today.

I'm not sure. But at this point we don't have any\n\nintention of doing so.\"\nSpurrier told ESPN Tuesday that he would probably prefer coaching college if he decides to get back into coaching and that it was more enjoyable to him and probably seemed like more of a fit.\nSaban issued a statement Tuesday saying he was not interested in\n\nleaving the Tigers.\nThe Dolphins also must hire a new president because Jones plans\n\nto retire in March. Spielman, widely criticized for his personnel\n\ndecisions, will lead the coaching search and return next season\n\n\"unless something happens that I don't foresee,\" Jones said.\nBates, whose last head-coaching job was 19 years ago in the\n\nUSFL, has been with the Dolphins since Wannstedt hired him as\n\ndefensive coordinator in 2000.

The Dec. 5 game between the Broncos and Chargers could determine the winner of the AFC West. The Broncos should go in 8-3 if they can beat the Saints and Raiders. The Chargers may be a game behind if they can't beat the Chiefs on the road the week before. The Chargers' 3-4 defense matches up well in trying to stop the Broncos zone-blocking scheme, which is run mostly out of a two-tight end set. Adjustments by Chargers defensive coordinator Wade Phillips could be the key. But the Chargers could be the most dramatically improved offense down the stretch if \n comes off the bye with a healthy groin. The addition of \n to go with likely Pro Bowl tight end \n has opened up an offense that is surprising everyone by averaging 29.1 points a game.\n2.  Quarterback changes will be interesting to follow during the second half of the schedule. In the short term, the Jets have to win a few games with \n filling in for \n and \n can't allow much dropoff for the Jaguars. Still, among the non-playoff teams, the Bills will at some point go to \n in the next three or four weeks and \n may carry the Dolphins' offense in their final seven games. There appears little chance the Bengals will go back to \n to provide an offensive spark. \n may not have been great, but he hasn't been bad and the team has won three home games with him at the helm.\n3.  How the Raiders and Browns finish will determine if the AFC will have any other coaching changes after the season. The AFC is the better conference. The AFC has a 21-13 record against the NFC. Except for the Dolphins, no team appears to be on pace for more than 10 losses. Still, a lot of eyes are on the Browns to see how they finish. Butch Davis has control of the coaching and personnel decisions, and he's 3-5 with a tough closing schedule. If the season slips away from him, owner Randy Lerner needs to decide if he wants to bring in a general manager or to evaluate the coach. Norv Turner needs more time to establish his system but the roster is a mess. After being too old at receiver, now the Raiders are too young. Kerry Colllins' deep arm isn't getting it done. There is no running game. And the defense has been horrible. Al Davis doesn't like horrible.\n4.  The Steelers have a two-game lead over the Ravens, but don't have their home game against them until Dec. 26. Before then, \n has to go on the road four times and will be tested in hostile climates. His two road wins came in strange conditions. The fringe of a hurricane allowed him to play in the slop in Miami and win 13-3. In Texas Stadium, thousands of Steelers fans made Roethlisberger's game against the Cowboys sound like a home game. He came from behind to win, 24-20. Trips to Cleveland, Cincinnati, Jacksonville and the \n will determine if Roethlisberger will be playing on the road in the playoffs or at home.\n5.  Peyton Manning's pursuit of Dan Marino's record for touchdown passes in a season (48) could be a highlight of the second half. No one thought anyone would come close to Marino's mark. \n of the Vikings made people think it was vulnerable with 19 touchdown passes in five games. Now, Manning is on pace for 52 touchdowns with 26 in the first eight games. The only top five defenses the Colts face down the stretch are the Ravens (Dec. 19) and the Broncos (Jan. 2).

In this case, it's more a reflection of the rest of the team and the schedule.\nCincinnati (3-5) has one of the NFL's worst defenses, allowing opponents to pile up 351 yards a game and a league-worst 150 per game on the ground. Palmer rarely has the advantage of playing to protect a lead -- he's usually forced to throw into a blitzing\n\ndefense in the fourth quarter.\nThe offensive line has been a hodgepodge because of injuries, a weakness that opponents regularly exploit. Pro Bowl right tackle \n is the latest casualty, playing with torn cartilage in his knee.\nDespite the turmoil, Palmer has developed.

He's handled things well, handled the ups and downs.\n\"For some reason, he just keeps getting blamed for things. But Carson's had about two bad plays, maybe three, that prevent us from winning games at times. I wish all our guys had that few,\" he said.\nMost of those mistakes involve trying to force a pass into coverage during one of those frantic comeback attempts, resulting in an interception. He has six touchdown passes and 10 interceptions overall but has gotten better in the last four games -- only three interceptions.\n\"I think I've learned a lot from forcing the ball into places,\" he said.\nHis improvement was on display against Dallas, when he smoothly executed a conservative game plan. More than half of his 21 completions went to tight ends and running backs, a low-risk approach that brought boos from the home crowd but plaudits from the coaches.\n\"It's tough on the fans,\" Palmer said. \"I can understand why they're frustrated, because you get frustrated thinking, 'Man, we should be taking more shots downfield. There should be more open.'\n\"I've also learned that just completions put pressure on the defense, whether it be a dump-off to the fullback. That puts more pressure on the defense than taking shots and trying to hit Chad (Johnson) on the deep post,\" he said.\nPalmer has been under nearly constant pressure from an array of respected defenses. He has already faced four defenses currently ranked in the league's top 10 for yards and points allowed.

{"title": "Rams hope Edwards can help secondary problems", "text": "\nIt could take several months, perhaps even more, for deposed \n head coach Dave Wannstedt to land his next job. For safety \n, the first player victim of the Dolphins' coaching change, the wait was momentary.\nThe six-year veteran, whose contract was abruptly terminated Wednesday, was awarded to the \n on waivers Thursday night, ESPN.com has learned. The Rams and \n were the only two franchises to submit waiver claims on Edwards, who had started eight of the Dolphins' nine games this season.\nSt. Louis was awarded Edwards' rights by having the poorer record of the two teams. Ironically, Atlanta attempted to sign Edwards as an unrestricted free agent this summer, but he opted for the Dolphins over proposals from the Falcons and Green Bay, the team with whom he played his first five NFL seasons.\nIt was mildly surprising that a few more teams, such as Denver and Carolina, did not make waiver claims on Edwards.\nThere were many people, Edwards included, surprised by his release. Bothered by a groin injury, he had not played well lately, even he conceded, but no one anticipated he would be cut loose. The axing came after general manager Rick Spielman consulted with interim coach Jim Bates, and the two decided to replace Edwards with \n.\nEdwards, 27, becomes the latest candidate in St. Louis' seemingly endless quest for a quality defensive back to play in nickel and dime coverage packages. It has been a search that has led frustrated Rams officials and coaches in many different directions.\nOnly two weeks ago, the Rams signed six-year veteran cornerback\n\n\n, who has spent much of his career in the nickel role.\nThe laundry list of other veteran defensive backs who either signed with the Rams or agreed to contract terms includes \n, \n, \n, \n and \n. The Rams also chose Jason Shivers in the fifth round of the draft, believing he could fill a dime role, but he didn't play well enough in the preseason to win a roster spot and is instead on the team's practice squad.\nThe perpetually injured Knight was hurt in camp, placed on injured reserve, and then released. Bronson suffered a season-ending injury and Sehorn, who played with the Rams last season, failed his physical examination because of a foot problem. Lassiter played in three games in a dime role and on specials teams, collected 11 tackles, but was released in late October. Originally released by the Rams in camp, Lucas was re-signed by the club during a spate of injuries, and remains on the roster in a backup role. McBride has played in one game since signing a one-year contract.\nSt. Louis will inherit the one-year, $535,000 contract that Edwards signed with Miami this summer. Prorated over the balance of the season, that means St. Louis is responsible for $251,765. The Rams, who are at the 53-man limit, will have to make a move to create a spot for Edwards on their roster.\nIn his eight games with the Dolphins this season, Edwards had 45 tackles, one sack, one forced fumble and six passes defensed. A first-round pick of the Packers in '99, Edwards has appeared in 62 games and has 201 tackles, seven interceptions, 23 passes defensed and three sacks in his career.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1921127"},

{"title": "Phillips signed through 2008", "text": "\nOne of the considerations in \n's decision to release \n in the offseason was that team officials believed third-year veteran \n would bring more athleticism to the strong safety position.\nThrough the first half of the 2004 season, Phillips has done nothing to alter that opinion, and the Bucs have demonstrated their faith in the youngster by signing him to a four-year contract extension.\nPhillips will be paid about $9.5 million over the course of a contract that runs through the 2008 season. A fifth-round choice in the 2002 draft, Phillips received a $1 million signing bonus and a $1.35 million roster bonus that is due next spring. The base salaries are $1.135 million each for the 2004-06 seasons, then $1.75 million in 2007 and $2.05 million for 2008.\nGetting the versatile Phillips secured for the future was a priority for Bucs officials, who believe he will develop into a Pro Bowl performer in the next few seasons. The team also wants to keep free safety \n, who is eligible for unrestricted free agency after this season, but extension talks with him have bogged down.\nTeam officials have been touting Phillips -- who has prototype size, good range and is aggressive in forcing the run -- since Lynch's departure. The former University of Georgia standout, who played primarily on special teams early in his career but showed natural awareness in an expanded role in 2003, has not disappointed.\n\"He runs sideline to sideline ... and he's a sure tackler, he's got good ball skills and is tough, reliable and disciplined,\" coach Jon Gruden said.\nIn eight games, Phillips has 61 tackles, one interception, one sack and five passes defensed for a Bucs defense that ranks No. 4 in the NFL. While his coverage skills still need development, Phillips has enough speed to improve in that area, and he is already a factor in run defense.\nIn training camp, when Phillips displayed the kind of diversity rare to the strong safety position, it became obvious that he was a burgeoning star. His teammates, despite loyalty to the departed Lynch, lauded Phillips' athleticism and acknowledged that he would become a significant playmaker. While his contract represents a healthy raise, the numbers are relatively palatable.\nMoving to create some cap space, the Bucs also renegotiated the contract of fullback \n, lowering his 2004 cap value by about $700,000. The new deal for Alstott extends his contract through 2008, but he likely will be gone from the Bucs by that point, or will have reworked the contract again.\nThe cap charge is such that the Bucs can probably afford to retain Alstott through the '05 season, but not beyond, when his cap charge escalates to more than $5 million annually.", "url": "http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1921591"},

{"title": "Seahawks out to avoid sweep", "text": "\n \n For more than two weeks following their Oct. 10 loss to the Rams, the Seahawks were in a funk.\nThey had blown a 17-point lead to the Rams during the final eight minutes of their important home game and lost in overtime, 33-27. Coach Mike Holmgren's clock management was questioned. Coverage problems were exposed in the secondary. Confidence waned.\nWhat followed was a flat first-half performance and eventual loss to the Patriots  and then a bad loss to the Cardinals on the road. Then, Holmgren pulled in the reins. He uncomplicated the offense, cutting down the offensive game plan by more than 30 plays. Quarterback \n called less play adjustments along with blocking changes at the line.\nThe Seahawks relied on their talent and play execution and scored 65 points in victories over the Panthers and 49ers. But these are the Rams coming up Sunday. To get over the hump and be a division winner, the Seahawks need to exorcise their ghosts when playing the Rams. It won't be easy.\nAs they did in October, the Rams enter the game in a bit of a crisis. The Seahawks were 3-0 heading into that game. The Rams were 2-2 and in jeopardy of falling 2¬Ω games behind. Division hopes could fade if they lose this crucial home game. They would fall behind by two games and face tough road trips to Buffalo and Green Bay.\nConversely, the Seahawks follow Sunday's game with three home games against teams with combined records of  7-18. Even if the Seahawks lose, they have a good chance of being 8-4 heading into the final four games.\nExecution will be the key for the Seahawks. They have let \n carry the offense more with his running game. He's averaging 29 carries and 177.5 yards the past two weeks. Hasselbeck has been pinpoint precise even though his receiving corps has been banged up with ankle injuries. The offensive line has come together for its best games of the season.\nHowever, bad memories still remain from the Rams collapse. The Seahawks remember how \n picked them apart for 202 yards passing over a 10-minute span that carried into the overtime. Bulger exposed coverage problems at safety. When defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes went to zone blitzes, Bulger attacked the single coverage of their safeties for big plays and touchdowns. Rhodes will have to find answers.\nPressuring the quarterback won't be as easy for the Seahawks. \n may try to play after coming off a broken kneecap, but he won't be at full speed if he can be on the field. The four-man rush without him has had a tough time applying pressure.\nThe Rams have their own problems. They've lost back-to-back games and their defense is getting carved up. Coach Mike Martz is thinking of making a change or two along the offensive line.\nThe Oct. 10 game might have been the game of the year, and this one has the potential to challenge it.\n \n This game has major playoff implications. The Jets started 6-1 but they face an uphill climb of catching the Patriots for the AFC East crown. Their second-half schedule features six games against teams with .500 records or better and they might have to play half of them without quarterback \n. The Ravens trail the Steelers by two games in the AFC North, so they can't afford to lose a potential wild-card tie-breaker to the Jets unless they get hot. It's a big game. It should also be a quick game. Both teams will try to run the ball. That's been the strategy all year for the Ravens, who have one of the thinnest wide receiving crews. Baltimore's \n wasn't happy he didn't get 25 carries against the Browns and coach Brian Billick agreed. Lewis needs 25 carries to wear down defenses. With Pennington out, the Jets will continue to overuse halfback \n, who is on pace for 390 carries this season. New Jets signal caller \n ran a ball-control offense in Dallas last year and took them to the playoffs. He has better runners in New York. Of the two teams, the Ravens may have to take a few more chances because they are on the road. The defense rarely allows teams to score 20-plus points, but the Ravens need a few big plays to win.\n \n Coming off their Monday loss to the Colts, the Vikings proved they could move the football without wide receiver \n, who will sit out against the Packers. Quarterback \n threw for only 169 yards, but the Vikings scored 28 points in a three-point loss to Indy. The Packers are well rested from a bye week and face a tough second-half schedule. Quarterback \n was able to rest a bruise hand and crooked right thumb. Running back \n was able to get his second wind and should come out with a strong running effort. For the Vikings to win, they will need a big defensive effort and a strong running game. \n will start and is their best pure running back. Coach Mike Tice will mix in \n and \n in situations. What Tice can't do is leave his defense on the field too much to be picked part by Favre. Last year, the Vikings got off to a 6-0 start with a season-opening victory in Green Bay. The Packers took the entire season to come back and take the division title away from them. Their rivalry is starting late and will be even more intense.\n \n The Texans were flat in last week's 31-13 loss to the Broncos. Coach Dom Capers couldn't explain it. The Texans spent the first half of the season putting themselves in playoff contention for the first time in franchise history. The Colts could extinguish it quickly if they don't get out of that funk. Offensively, the Texans have the firepower to stay with the Colts and their confidence could be boosted by watching tapes of the Jaguars victory in Indianapolis. The Texans play the Colts two times over the next five weeks so they have the ability to stay in the race. Finding answers for \n won't be easy. He has 26 touchdown passes and the Texans have coverage problems at safety. Broncos quarterback \n was responsible for having \n benched following a long completion last Sunday, so the Texans will be relying on a rookie \n. Earl is the third rookie in the Texans starting defensive lineup, a defense that appeared to turn the corner before the Denver loss.\n \n The Jaguars will have to run a different offense now that 245-pound quarterback \n is replacing the injured \n. The Jaguars' success was going to a more finesse three-receiver, shotgun offense for Leftwich. He was regularly getting 20-25 point scoring efforts from the spread offense. Now, coach Jack Del Rio will have to pull back the offense and rely more on the running of \n. Garrard can make plays on draws and bootlegs, but he can't match the throwing skills of Leftwich. Running up the middle won't be easy because the Lions have defensive tackles \n and \n. Still, the Lions have hit the wall. Coach Steve Mariucci says the team has about 10-12 Lions playing with injuries and it shows. The Lions are on a two-game losing streak and both sides of the ball are starting to fade. Quarterback \n doesn't have a completely healthy \n at wide receiver because of an ankle injury. The running game is nonexistent. Blocking along the line is crumbling. This might be the last chance for the Lions to get their confidence back on defense. Following the Jaguars game, the Lions face the Vikings and Colts in a 11-day stretch.\n\n\n \n Pittsburgh's \n has to take his Rookie of the Year Show on the road, and those games won't be as easy as his last two victories. Games against the Browns and Bengals are division rivals. Running back \n has that tender hamstring. The Cleveland game will be tough because the Browns have a defense that can get into the head of a young quarterback. But Roethlisberger has been unlike most young quarterbacks. He's conquered every challenge so far in a 6-0 start. Roethlisberger enters with the confidence of whipping the Browns 34-23 in Week 5 and completing 16 of 21 passes for 231 yards. Next week the Steelers travel to Cincinnati, another division rival. The Browns suffered a big blow along their already troubled offensive line losing guard \n for the season. That puts more pressure on quarterback \n to keep the offense going.\n \n The Falcons can start to wrap up the NFC South if they can win this game. They would open a four-game lead on the Bucs if they can win, and they already have a three-game lead on the Saints. But the Bucs are playing better football with \n at quarterback. He's working the offense efficiently and things are getting better now that he has offensive weapons. The receiving corps is healthy for the first time this year and \n is a hot running back. This game will be the barometer whether the Falcons can cruise to the division title or if it's going to be a dogfight. Only two NFC South games have been played to date. Each team has five of its six division games remaining. The Falcons are coming off a bye week and know they can make a statement by winning. The Bucs defense excels against the pass. They have a 77 quarterback rating against them and allow only 55.7 percent of completions. Falcons quarterback \n has only eight games in the West Coast offense and will have trouble on third downs, but he needs to get at least six or seven third down conversions against the Bucs to win.\n \n Quarterback \n should be back but will the Titans? This is a proud team that had a miserable season before the bye week. The salary cap forced them to be young at several positions, and injuries have held them back all season. On paper, though, this should be a mismatch. Going into the season, the Titans had hopes of the Super Bowl. Now, they are fighting an uphill battle to get to .500. The rest should help the Titans. McNair does not have all the offensive weapons of the past, but he has a good line and a powerful running back, \n who has 810 yards. The Bears defensive line has come together. Defensive tackle \n is making a bid for Defensive Rookie of the Year. Last week against the Giants, the Bears had 15 quarterback hurries and 15 knockdowns. But to win, they need quarterback \n to pull a victory against a good team on the road. Running back \n probably won't play because of a toe injury. Titans coach Jeff Fisher knows how to drive young quarterbacks crazy. Though the Bears are showing promise, this game isn't a good matchup for them.\n \n Patriots coach Bill Belichick survived a crisis in the secondary by playing wide receiver \n at cornerback and linebacker \n at safety in beating the Rams last Sunday. Cornerbacks \n and \n are out, so Belichick will be patching again, but at least he will be doing it at home. At least, he will be doing it against the Bills quarterback \n, whom he's always had success against. For the Bills, this is their season, and Bledsoe has to rally the offense. Since their last meeting, the Bills offense has rallied. \n is regularly getting 100-yard rushing games. Wide receiver \n is having a Pro Bowl season, and \n, the rookie, is coming on. But a loss puts the Bills five games behind the Patriots with only seven games left. It won't help that third receiver \n may not play with a knee injury and that right tackle \n is questionable with a neck injury. It also won't help if reporters hang around owner Ralph Wilson asking for critiques of the offensive game plan. The only chance the Bills have is to run a boring ball-control offense to keep down the score.\n\n\n \n Cowboys coach Bill Parcells isn't getting through to this team. His orders aren't being executed, and the franchise appears to be lost. A Monday night game against the Eagles is a motivating factor and focus should be better. But do the Cowboys have the talent to matchup against the Eagles? Probably not. And the bad news is that the Cowboys have to play them again in five weeks and by then, the Cowboys may be playing \n at quarterback. Any faint hope of the playoffs come down to the Cowboys winning this game. The Eagles running game should be better now that \n had an extra week to get through the pain of his cracked rib. The Cowboys cornerbacks don't matchup well against wide receiver \n. But it's Monday Night and there will be emotion and energy. That could give Parcells a chance to get one of the most inspired efforts from this team. The question is whether an inspired Cowboys team is good enough to stay with the Eagles.\n \n For draft watchers, this is an important game. The 49ers and Panthers have only one victory apiece and the 49ers play the one-win Dolphins in two weeks. This will start to sort out the first pick in the draft. The 49ers have the edge because the Panthers are running out of players. Panthers halfback \n can't figure out why his sore knee doesn't get any better. He may try to play but don't count on him. Since the start of the season, the Panthers have placed seven players on injured reserve. The 49ers have some spark on offense with \n at quarterback, but their injured defense is crumbling because of injuries. Too bad we can't get Mel Kiper Jr. to officiate this game. This is a draft special.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&page=/ten/2004week10"},

{"title": "Stokley continues to shine", "text": "\nINDIANAPOLIS -- He is making a league-minimum base salary of $535,000 this season, and making a lot more big plays than several NFL receivers who are earning several times that much, but \n wideout \n made it clear Sunday that he can't even begin to see himself in another offense that better suits his skills.\n\"This place and this offense, well, they're perfect for me,\" said Stokley, who has already voided the segment of his contract that extends beyond this season, making him eligible for unrestricted free agency in the spring. \"It's like I'm in heaven, really, and I can't ask for a better situation. I know I've got it pretty good here.\"\nOK, so maybe, tempted by the lure of free agency and perhaps the promise of some fast-talkin' general manager who thinks Stokley can line up as a No. 2 receiver, the sixth-year veteran bolts Indianapolis next spring for a bigger paycheck. Says here, and this is just a suggestion, that Stokley would be crazy to ever abandon this offense.\nAnd it says, too, that even though Indianapolis will have far more significant free agent concerns, with the potential for wide receiver \n and running back \n to hit the open market, the Colts would be nuts to allow Stokley to escape.\nHis performance on Sunday offered yet another reason why Stokley is the square peg in the round hole in the Colts' offense -- he had five catches for 132 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns -- and why he is fast becoming one of the NFL's premier slot receivers.\nFlanked by Harrison and \n, and with James now softening up defenses with the run again, Stokley has flourished big-time in the Colts offense. He now has 41 catches for a team-best 665 yards and five touchdowns and Sunday was this third 100-yard outing of the season.\nMore important, he has provided \n, whose five touchdown passes Sunday raised his league-leading total to 31, with the additional option every quarterback covets. Most league defenses don't have even two cornerbacks sufficiently skilled to try to keep up with Harrison and the ever-emerging Wayne. But add Stokley to the equation, and the task of stopping the Indianapolis passing game is nearly impossible.\n\"We played (poorly),\" acknowledged Houston cornerback \n, \"but they just seem to have weapons all over the place. It's so hard to keep them all under wraps. You concentrate on Marvin and Wayne and then that No. 83 guy (Stokley) makes all kinds of plays. With him, it's even tougher to keep them down.\"\nFact is, about the only thing that slowed the Indianapolis offense was its own mistakes (seven penalties, including three false-start calls on one series), and the game officials. The crew, led by referee Bill Carollo, was ponderously slow. And there were a trio of replay challenges in the first half that really forced things to drag.\nHouston coach Dom Capers actually used all three first-half timeouts on one Colts offensive series. Two of the timeouts came on instant replay challenges, plays where it seemed Capers had no chance of overturning the on-field call, that were upheld. And he actually used one timeout to stop the clock so he could make the second replay challenge.\nManning completed 18 of 27 attempts for 320 yards, with the five touchdown passes and a pair of uncharacteristic interceptions, for a quarterback rating of 115.7. Harrison had just two catches for 22 yards, and likely wasn't happy about that production, but Manning certainly spread the ball around.\nIn addition to Stokley's standout performance, which included a 69-yard touchdown catch on the first possession of the second half, tight end \n had a big day. The two-year veteran grabbed three catches for 102 yards and two touchdowns. His biggest play was an 80-yard touchdown, when Manning was flushed out of the pocket to his right, and Texans free safety \n whiffed badly on an interception attempt.\nIn recent weeks, Manning has begun going to his tight ends again, and that just further complicates things for opposition defensive coordinators.\nSunday marked the fourth straight game in which Clark, who had but two receptions for 68 yards in the first five outings of the year, posted three catches. He has 264 yards (a healthy 22.0-yard average) and four touchdowns on those dozen catches. Fellow tight end \n has 10 catches for 119 yards and three scores in that same period, after only eight receptions for 56 yards the first five games.\n\"Definitely, there are a lot of weapons here,\" agreed Stokley, who began his career with Baltimore but was signed by the Colts in 2003, in part because Manning, who used him as an instructor as his annual passing game, lobbied for him. \"Peyton is doing a great job of spreading it around. All you can ask is to get your share, you know?\"\nRight now, Stokley is certainly his share, and making the most of his opportunities.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1922957"},
{"title": "Tice picks least-used tailback", "text": "\nThe player who has logged the fewest carries in Minnesota's four-man tailback rotation will get the start in the most important game on the \n' schedule to this point.\nIn somewhat of a surprise, coach Mike Tice will start \n Sunday at Green Bay, perhaps in an effort to pull the Vikings out of a nosedive that has seen their once healthy NFC North lead whittled to one game over the \n and \n.\nBennett, 26, who has missed 13 games to injuries since a 2002 Pro Bowl season in which he rushed for a career-best 1,296 yards, has started just one game this season. And in that game, against Tennessee on Oct. 24, he gave way to \n after only one snap.\nAmong Minnesota's cadre of tailbacks, certainly the NFL's deepest, rookie \n, Smith and even short-yardage specialist \n all have more rushes and more yards than Bennett's 11 carries and 38 yards for one touchdown. Smith, generally acknowledged as the team's top back, served a four-game suspension earlier this season because of a repeat violation of the NFL substance abuse policy.\nTice didn't offer much insight into his decision, except to note that Smith bruised his shoulder in Monday night's loss at Indianapolis. Smith, however, is not listed on the league injury report and said his shoulder is not a factor. While he will not start, Smith, who rushed for 80 yards against the Colts, is likely to get considerable playing time.\nA four-year veteran and former first-round draft choice, Bennett has privately chafed over his lack of action and is expected to seek a postseason trade. He declined interview requests this week. The former Wisconsin star missed the first five games this season with a knee injury, and a broken foot limited him to eight games in 2003. When Bennett returned from his knee injury this year, Tice publicly noted that he would have to \"earn his way\" back into the starting lineup.\nIn his three appearances, Bennett has not carried more than five times. Since the outset of '03, he has just one game with more than 15 carries, and he has not rushed more than 20 times since November 2002.\nWith wide receiver \n sidelined for a second straight outing, the Vikings are expected to focus on a more balanced offense, as was the case Monday night. Minnesota is the 11th-ranked team in the league in rushing offense.\nThe divisional battle with the Packers is key for many reasons, not the least of which is that the Vikings have dropped two straight games after a sizzling 5-1 start in a slump that has evoked memories of last season. Minnesota lost seven of its final 10 games and failed to qualify for the playoffs in 2003 after opening 6-0.\nA loss to the Packers would leave each at 5-4, tied for the division  lead, and the Lions, who play at Jacksonville, could make it a threesome. A Minnesota loss also would cast further focus on Tice's future. He's in the final year of his contract, although the team has an option for 2005.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1922022"},

Simoneau has started all but one of his 24 games with the Eagles at middle linebacker, but played the weakside spot with Atlanta and was acquired by Philadelphia in a 2003 trade to line up on the outside.\nSo shoddy was the Philadelphia run defense in the loss to the Steelers that, at one point, all three starting linebackers were benched for a short time.\nThe proposed linebacker reshuffling, expected to be finalized later this week during preparation for Dallas on Monday night, might be just the start of a front seven overhaul as defensive coordinator Jim Johnson tries to find a combination to stop the recent hemorrhaging against the run.\nSecond-year defensive tackle \n, who had two sacks against the Steelers and has played the run well at times, could move into the lineup at the expense of \n. But Rayburn is recovering from injuries sustained in an automobile accident Monday night and is listed as questionable for Monday's game.\nIt would seem the Pittsburgh loss is the primary catalyst of change -- the Eagles surrendered 252 rushing yards, the most they've allowed since 1993, even though the Steelers played without starting tailback \n -- that game only magnified what had already become a problem.\nThe \n rushed for 170 yards against the Eagles in the opener before the Eagles stiffened against the run, surrendering an average of just 62.3 yards during the next three outings. But in the four games since limiting Chicago to a paltry 32 rushing yards Oct. 3, the Philadelphia defense has struggled versus the run.\nOver the last four games, the Eagles have allowed an average 172.0 yards rushing. In addition to the 252 yards gained by Pittsburgh, the Eagles have allowed 113 yards to the Ravens, 158 yards to injury-ravaged Carolina and 165 yards to Cleveland. The result: Philadelphia statistically ranks 27th versus the run at the halfway point of the season, allowing 130.6 rushing yards per game.\nTruth be told, that isn't much more than the 129.4 rushing yards per game permitted by Philadelphia in 2003, when it finished the season ranked No. 22 against the run. But with expectations ramped up and fueled by a 7-0 start before the Pittsburgh debacle, everything the Eagles do in 2004 is more closely scrutinized.\n\"We brought this on ourselves,\" acknowledged defensive end \n. \"Stopping the run used to be a little problem for us, but now it's a big problem.\"\nOne of the game's most creative coordinators, but known more for his aggressive blitz packages, Johnson is a bend-don't-break disciple. Normally, he isn't a guy who pays much attention to statistics. But his frustrations on the sideline last week were obvious and he apparently is intent on shoring up the run defense.\nTrotter, who started one game earlier this season when Simoneau was injured, might offer a stouter alternative in the middle. At the weakside spot, Simoneau should  be able to take advantage of his superior pursuit skills. But, as Trotter admonished the team in the locker room last Sunday evening, stopping the run is a mind-set the Eagles must regain.\n\"You've got to want to get your uniform dirty,\" he said. \"You've got to ignore it if you get your nose bloodied up a little.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1920787"},

{"title": "Martz gets tough with Rams", "text": "\nST. LOUIS -- Mike Martz has been praised and criticized for being the Mad Scientist of offense. Since last week's loss to the New England, Martz was just mad.\nMad coaches live on the edge. Players usually respond big or fall flat. The Rams responded big Sunday. Martz cracked the whip earlier in the week and the Rams responded like a champion horse down the final furlong. Five days after Martz turned his Wednesday practice into a live scrimmage, the Rams hit the turf looking to hit somebody.\n fired 13 straight passes coming off the opening kickoff, completing eight for 119 yards. Defenders chased down Seahawks offensive players relentlessly. Before the game was 18 minutes old, the Rams had a 17-0 lead on the way to what turned out to be a convincing 23-12 victory. The win gives the Rams all the tiebreaker edges in the now-even NFC West.\n\"We had to go back to basics and identify things that we are not doing well, tidy them up and get them cleaned up on Wednesday,\" Martz said. \"The players appreciated it. They responded very well.\"\n might not be the right word here. For the usually jovial Martz, the days leading up to the victory over the Seahawks was much like an episode of Fear Factor. For seven days, there was no more Mr. Nice Guy.\nIt appeared the players' coach had turned anti-player after back-to-back losses. His quotes to the St. Louis press were classics. One quote: \"We don't hold hands and get in a s√©ance and sing Kumbaya.\" Then there was this one straight from Jim Fassel's quotebook: \"You're on the train or you're not. Get out, period. I know where I'm going, you're either with me or you're not.\"\nThis was coaching. The masterful strategist calls it an \"attitude adjustment.\" He called out the team publicly. Privately, he called out a handful of players for not doing their jobs. He threatened putting players on the bench. He put tape together to show sloppy or non-existent effort. The embarrassing loss to Miami in particular caught everyone's attention.\n\"He showed us videotape of the Miami game where guys quit running,\" safety \n said. \"Those are things we had gotten away from. You can't give up on a play. You need 11 hats getting to the football. Playing hard and playing aggressive is the key to a lot of things. If you have that down, schemes take care of themselves. It's more attitude than anything.\"\nWednesday's practice was wild. It started after Martz cut a 15-minute press conference 10 minutes short with quick, terse answers. He stormed to the practice field and treated the players worse than the writers. Hitting was live. \"I've never been in a practice like that,\" halfback \n said. Linemen could hit as if they were in a game. Backs could be tackled.\nTo make matters worse, Martz stormed around the practice field with his whistle and nasty attitude. He chided the defense if they gave up 2 yards by saying \"2 yards is too much.\" He called out players who didn't hustle.\n\"We had a nine-on-seven drill that was live and I had a whistle,\" Martz said. \"If the offense started to run against our defense, I would yell, 'First do-o-o-o-w-n, Seattle,'\" Martz said, trying to sound like retired ref Red Cashion. \"We had fun.\"\nThe point was made. Hustle or get out. So the Rams hustled. Perhaps there was no batter example than \n' hustle in the fourth quarter. Seahawks halfback \n broke a 35-yard run down the left side of the field. He maneuvered around Rams defenders, but Williams, who had been in man coverage, chased him down and stripped the ball from his hands at the Rams' 14.\nRemember, this is a Rams defense that had only two interceptions and five forced fumbles in eight games. Williams, the Rams' oldest position player at 36, saved a potential touchdown. This was the same Williams who lost his starting free safety job this week because of a stinger problem that had affected his play.\n\"There he is coming up with a big play, yanking the ball out and we get the ball,\" Martz said. \"That was probably the turning point and the most critical point in the game for him to make that play. I'm very proud of this team and how they responded. The most important thing at this point is next week, and we need to continue with this type of effort.\"\nWhich means more physical Wednesdays.\n\"We needed to get aggressive,\" Williams said. \"That's the definition of football. Football is hitting. Coach Martz has attempted a number of things to motivate this team. We knew what was needed. We had lost a couple of games, and we were being embarrassed.\"\nFor years, Martz was criticized for being too soft on his players. During bye weeks, he gives players the entire week off. During the first four years, they won each game after the bye week. But last week after the bye, they lost by 18 to the Patriots. No more Mr. Nice Guy.\nTo his critics, Martz is basically saying, \"Screw it.\" He's criticized for not running the ball enough, so he came out in his biggest game of the year Sunday and threw the ball 13 straight times. His defense wasn't going to lose focus in the red zone. Six times, the Seahawks penetrated the Rams' 30. They ended up with four field goals, two turnovers and only 12 points.\n\"We knew we had to get it in gear,\" Archuleta said. \"We don't like to do the things we did in practice, but evidently it works. We were more physical. As players, you don't like it, but as players, you control that by playing well and we hadn't done that. Our pursuit was outstanding today.\"\nSo was the Rams' resilience. The offense survived plenty of adversity. In the first quarter, wide receiver \n was leveled by Seahawks safety \n. He suffered a concussion that was so bad he started talking about credits needed to graduate in college. Martz shut him down for the rest of the game.\nIn the second half, the Rams lost two offensive linemen -- guard \n to a minor knee injury and left tackle \n to an ejection for bumping into side judge Don Carlson. \n moved from right tackle to left tackle. \n, who came out of retirement to be a backup, played left guard. \n finished the game at right tackle.\nThe Rams settled into more of a running game in the second half and ended up with 202 yards rushing on 31 carries, a very un-Martz-like performance. \"Those things happen with the running game when you come out passing,\" Martz said.\nSo the harder practices will continue.\n\"I think that this team needed that,\" Martz said. \"We had gotten into practice habits that were more geared to the veterans. In 2001, we were in shorts and sweatshirts for most of the time in practice. They knew how to play and they had been playing together for a long time. It was just a coaching error on my part. We have to get back to basics with a lot of these guys, like taking blocks and shedding them. Wednesdays are violent practices and that is the way it has to be for a while.\"\nThe Rams now have back-to-back cold weather games in Buffalo and Green Bay.

{"title": "'Hawks start slow, never recover", "text": "\nST. LOUIS -- The schedule makers were kind to the Seahawks. With a 5-4 record following Sunday's 23-12 loss to the Rams, the Seahawks have upcoming home games against three losing teams -- the Dolphins, Bills and Cowboys -- so improving to 8-4 is within reach.\nBut even if that happens, the Seahawks won't have much credibility as a likely playoff team. They are 0-3 against teams with winning marks and 5-1 against losing teams. Against the Rams, though, they are predictable. Whether it's by building a big lead early and blowing it or digging themselves a big hole, they can't beat St. Louis.\nOn Sunday, the Seahawks got off to a horrible start. They fell behind 17-0 early in the second quarter and couldn't reach the end zone. They made six trips to the Rams' 27-yard line or beyond and ended up with four field goals and two turnovers.\nSix trips to the 27 and coming up with only 12 points is embarrassing and it leaves them in a tie with Rams, who own the tiebraker because of their season sweep,  at 5-4 for the NFC West lead.\n\"They've won close games, and with that comes the confidence and the belief that no matter what happens, they will win,\" Seahawks linebacker \n said. \"And I think that confidence also brings a calmness where you don't press and you don't make mistakes. You know, you can be in the most chaotic moments but still manage to be (mentally) clear and make the play.\"\nNeither applied to the Seahawks on Sunday. On their first offensive play, the Seahawks were their own worst enemy.\nThe play was a much expected \n run call, a byproduct of a move three weeks ago to simplify the offense. Alexander's right knee crashed into \n's right knee and the play lost two yards.\nIt was going to be that kind of day for the Seahawks.\n\"It is just a bummer,\" Hasselbeck said. \"It was the first play of the game. For that to happen was just unbelievable. It was just a bad bounce.\"\nWhat followed wasn't much better. The league leader in dropped passes (23 in the first eight games), the Seahawks had two dropped passes by wide receiver \n and several other incompletions in which receivers didn't hustle toward passes.\nSeahawks safeties played Rams receivers deep but got consistently burned on deep post routes and slant passes -- two of St. Louis' favorite pass plays. Minus defensive end \n, the Seahawks defensive line can't put any pressure on the quarterback, so \n had enough time to complete 23-of-34 for 262 yards and one touchdown. Bulger hit eight of his first 13 passes for 119 yards in leading the Rams to two first-quarter touchdown drives.\n\"Once they settled in, we got a little aggressive with some of our things and we mixed it up a little bit,\" Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said. \"They're a talented team passing the ball. They got on one of those rolls. It didn't appear to matter what we did early. It was 17-0 before you could blink, and then we kind of settled in and played them pretty good.\"\nBut good wasn't good enough. Against good teams, the Seahawks either can't start games strong or can't finish them well. They started horribly against the Patriots and in Sunday's game against the Rams. They jumped to a 17-point lead and then blew it against the Rams in October.\n\"What's happening right know is we're not serious enough about winning,\" linebacker \n said. \"We've got to get a little more serious. When you play with purpose, you don't make mistakes. You don't come out and play like we did in the first half and then think we are going to get them in the second half.\"\nEspecially when you have to settle for four field goals in the red zone.\n\"You can always tell if a team is going to win or lose by how they play in the red zone,\" said Alexander, who finished with 176 yards on 22 carries. \"We were there, like, every time and came away with field goals. You never win like that.\"\nThe NFC West is still open for the Seahawks to win, but they have to fix their many problems. They have to fix their safety coverage. They must get better in the red zone. They must get a better pass rush with the four-man line when Wistrom comes back next week.\n\"I don't think they are better than us,\" Brown said. \"I just think they're more polished than us. They came out and jumped on us with a 17-point lead. You know we were in a hole from the get go. They've got guys over there and they've been doing it for a while longer than us. So we're a team on the rise and until we get it done and until we start making things happen, you know, they control this division right now.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1922948"},

It's Miami's most\n\nsignificant personnel move since coach Dave Wannstedt resigned last\n\nweek.\nWannstedt drew criticism for his loyalty to the older, more\n\nexperienced Fiedler.

I'm not worried about what happened\n\nthe first 10 weeks.\"\nAcquired in March for a second-round draft pick, Feeley replaced Fiedler midway through the season opener, started the second and third games, then returned to the bench.

He said linebackers coach \n will make calls from the sideline during games, and secondary coach Mel Phillips will have more responsibility during the week.\nBates made his decisions over the bye weekend after consulting with the rest of the staff and studying tape of every Miami game this season.

{"title": "Questionable call, clock management haunt Jets", "text": "\nHEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -- Somehow, Jets coach Herman Edwards\n\nallowed his team to lose another game because of clock management\n\nissues and questionable play calling.\nNow they might have a hard time recovering.\nEdwards did all he could in the offseason to avoid the same\n\nproblems that have plagued his teams throughout his four-year\n\ntenure. He assigned assistant coach Dick Curl to concentrate solely\n\non time management, and drew up countless late-game scenarios for\n\nhow to handle the clock in any situation.\nLittle good that did in a 20-17 overtime loss to Baltimore.\nPerhaps even more galling than a failed halfback option pass\n\nthat let Baltimore back into the game was the way the Jets and\n\n\n botched their chance to win it in regulation by\n\nmismanaging the clock.\nEdwards took responsibility for it all, covering for the\n\nmistakes Carter made.\n\"I really let the team down,\" Edwards said. \"I didn't do a\n\ngood enough job coaching. I put our team in a bad situation, in\n\ncertain situations, and really cost them the game at the end of the\n\nday.\"\nCarter, who started his first game for the Jets in place of the\n\ninjured \n, shouldered none of the blame. He took a\n\nlimited number of questions Monday and brushed aside a reporter who\n\nhad one final query while being escorted out of the locker room.\n\"We can sit here on Monday and say would've should've,\n\ncould've, but we didn't get the job done and that's the bottom\n\nline,\" Carter said. \"I don't care how you say it or what finger\n\nyou point in or what direction you go. As a team, we didn't get the\n\njob done.\"\nThe first poor decision came with 1:56 to go before halftime,\n\nwith the Jets up 14-0. Offensive coordinator Paul Hackett took an\n\nuncharacteristic risk, calling the halfback pass by \n.\nEdwards had a chance to veto the call, but allowed it to unfold.\n\nIt ended in failure. Jordan tried to throw the ball away, but\n\ninstead \n intercepted. Baltimore went on to score 17 straight\n\npoints.\nThe Jets were clearly deflated, but had one final chance to make\n\nthings right. That is when things imploded.\nTrailing 17-14, Carter got a first down on a draw play to the\n\nRavens 4. But the Jets ticked off 32 seconds before the ball was\n\nsnapped because they had to get the play in and switch personnel\n\ngroups. When Jordan took the handoff on first-and-goal, 18 seconds\n\nremained.\nEdwards had no problem wasting all that time, because the Jets\n\nhad two timeouts left.\n\"We knew we had enough time to get three plays off,\" Edwards\n\nsaid.\nWrong. The Jets called timeout with 14 seconds left after Jordan\n\nran for 1 yard. Carter then threw incomplete on second-and-goal.\n\nEight seconds remained, enough time to try to score a touchdown.\nBut Edwards said the play call got down to Carter too late.\n\nCarter seemed to have no sense of urgency. When Carter broke the\n\nhuddle, Edwards realized there would be no time to get the play\n\noff, so he used their final timeout.\nEdwards never thought about taking a delay-of-game penalty to\n\nsave the timeout and push the Jets to third-and-8 with a chance to\n\nthrow into the end zone. Instead, they kicked a field goal to send\n\nthe game into overtime.\n\"We have to get the play into Quincy faster,\" Edwards said.\n\n\"There was 1 second on the play clock when I looked up there. I\n\nwasn't going to let the clock go down, put him in third-and-8, I\n\nwasn't going to do that to Quincy. We have to do a better job.\"\nEspecially with Pennington out again this week; he could miss\n\nanother two weeks with a strained right rotator cuff. Last year,\n\nthe Jets went into a nosedive when Pennington got injured in the\n\npreseason. They have to hope this loss is not the start of another\n\nfreefall.\n\"This is the most devastating loss we have had this season,\"\n\n\n said. \"There is a question mark, so that is what\n\nreally makes this one difficult.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1923625"},
{"title": "Boston winners? Pick 'em", "text": "\nFOXBORO, Mass. -- They had a harmonic hardware convergence shortly before kickoff in Gillette Stadium Sunday night. The defending Super Bowl champions welcomed in the freshly minted World Series champions for a wicked-haht celebration.\nFresh folk hero Johnny Damon sprinted across the field, still looking like Jim Morrison with better wheels. Curt Schilling, whose ankle will go down alongside Willis Reed's knee in the annals of famous injuries overcome, hobbled out of a golf cart on crutches. (In a hero-to-hero salute, Schilling was wearing a Tom Brady jersey.) The World Series trophy was held aloft to a standing ovation.\nAnd Titletown embraced its bad self.\nA region that spent most of the 20th century leaning hard on the Celtics for athletic glory is suddenly flush with millennial mastery. They simply don't lose these days in Massachusetts. (John Kerry prominently excepted.)\nThe Red Sox closed the baseball season with an eight-game winning streak of historic, epic, mythic and cathartic proportions. The Patriots, owners of two of the last three Vince Lombardi trophies, peeled off a league-record 21-game winning streak that stretched on for more than 12 months before ending two weeks ago. (After thrashing Buffalo 29-6 Sunday night, the new winning streak stands at two.)\nFor the first time in 25 years, since Pittsburgh ruled, the champions of pro football and pro baseball reside in the same city. Things have been so good, the Boston newspaper writers don't even remember how to rip somebody.\n\"This,\" proclaimed Pats fan Rob Anderson, \"is the apex of the sports universe.\"\nNow Boston College is riding the pros' coattails, upsetting West Virginia Saturday to gain the inside track for a Big East championship and BCS bid. Local boy John Ruiz retained the World Boxing Association heavyweight title Saturday night. Next thing you know, Heartbreak Hill will level out in time for the 2005 Boston Marathon.\nThis is all a radical change, of course. The Sox suffered under Yankees tyranny for a mere 86 years, and the Patriots went the first 42 years of their existence without winning it all -- not in the AFL, not in the NFL, not in their wildest dreams.\nThese days the Pats are the gold standard of the league, seemingly incapable of serious misstep.\nThey play in a Taj Mahal of a 2-year-old stadium, outdoors and on grass, having kept it real by resisting any temptation to play inside like the weenies in Atlanta, New Orleans, Minnesota, Detroit, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Houston. They won over the world when they shocked the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI, refusing individual introduction and instead coming out as a team. They have a roster full of team-first guys like wide receiver Troy Brown, who has been playing defensive back the last two weeks because of injuries (and who picked off his old teammate, Drew Bledsoe, Sunday night.) They have a quarterback who wins hearts with his looks and minds with his play, and who gracefully bears the burden of crossover celebrity. They have a taciturn coach whose utter disinterest in self promotion has helped make him a weird kind of New England cult hero.\nLife is so lovely here in Beantown that they even adore the team owner, Robert Kraft. That runs counter to the typical pro-town mentality of disliking and distrusting all ownership.\nBefore the Seattle game last month, fan Eric \"Duke\" Duquette was in line at a Port-A-John outside the stadium. Kraft came rolling by in a golf cart. Duquette shouted his appreciation of the owner. Kraft stopped the cart and gave Duquette a hug.\n\"How many owners would do that?\" asked Duquette, who is a lot to hug. The baseball coach at Pittsfield High School in New Hampshire, Duquette wears the jersey of former offensive lineman Bruce Armstrong -- and fills it about as amply as Armstrong used to.\nDuquette and his crew are in the New England minority -- bigger Patriots fans than Sox fans.\n\"Our bread is buttered right here,\" he said. \"It's our life.\"\nOutside of Duquette's tailgate party, the Red Sox rule -- and never more than now. You cannot swing a dead cat around here without hitting someone in a Sox hat, Sox sweatshirt, Sox jersey or, one would assume, Sox underwear.\nThe tailgaters were still crowing about The Comeback For All Time that beat the Yankees. (\"There's so much hatred for the Yankees up here, it's not even funny,\" Jason Marshall said.)\nAnd they were still talking about the 3.2 million people who reportedly flooded Boston for the Red Sox victory parade. (\"It's sick,\" Chuck Mason said. \"You can't fit 3.2 million into downtown Boston, but it's religion here.\")\nBut while the fans worry about which Sox wind up in pinstripes, they have this pleasant diversion of a football team to watch. Not a bad little squad.\n\"It's a good mainstream NFL town, but baseball is the obsession,\" said no less an authority than longtime Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan. \"But at one point football was No. 4, and I don't know of another market where that's case. Now it's 1A.\"\nRyan divides Patriots history into two periods: pre-Parcells and post-Parcells. The year before the Tuna arrived in 1993, New England had sold 18,000 season tickets and games were routinely blacked out.\n\"The minute Parcells arrived, the phones started ringing,\" Ryan said.\nAnd they haven't really stopped -- especially since the titles started rolling in under Bill Belichick. These days the fans show up regardless of the weather, and engaged in memorable snow-game revelry last season.\nIt snowed here Saturday, and the weather was none too balmy Sunday night. But neither cold weather nor $35 stadium parking were enough to chase away the tailgate crowd.\nTom Abernathy, recently retired from Raytheon, has been coming to Patriots games since the franchise was born in 1960. Sunday night he performed a classic New England gustatorial service for his tailgating crew, steaming 34 lobsters. While melting butter he talked about what the Pats mean to him.\n\"When the Pats won the Super Bowl for the first time,\" he said, \"it was a better feeling than when the Sox broke 'The Curse.' \"\nNot a soul at his tailgate party agreed with him, but that's the beauty of life these days in New England.

Hair color, eye color, skin color, it didn't matter. The uniform did. The carefully constructed bowtie, revealing a curvaceous chest. The size-too-small \"Daisy Dukes,\" barely covering the bottom of the backside. The white leather boots, ending just above the calf.\nThese are the first ladies of football. A group so popular that even after Monday's 49-21 triumph over the Cowboys, a throng of Eagles fans hung around the Texas Stadium tunnel and offered a rousing round of applause as each of the squad's 38 members exited. A group so popular that a 1979 television movie about the cheerleaders received a 60 percent share of the national audience, the highest rating for a made-for-TV movie that wasn't \"Roots.\"\nOakland has the Black Hole, Cleveland has the Dawg Pound, the Jets have Fireman Ed, but Dallas has the most iconic fan representation of all -- the world's most famous cheerleaders. Cowboys football without them is like pizza without cheese.\n\"They're an icon,\" said choreographer Judy Trammell, who cheered from 1980-84. \"When they put that uniform on, everybody knows who they are. They become instant celebrities.\"\nThat's why each April, some 600 girls from across the country gather in Dallas in hopes of becoming the next icon. The only requirement to try out? They must be 18 and have a high school diploma or GED. The unwritten requirements to make it? A basic understanding of dance; some semblance of intelligence; an outgoing, understanding, friendly, patient personality and, of course, \"a flattering figure.\"\n\"This group,\" Trammell said, as she pointed to the field, \"is always on. We only pick girls that this comes naturally to.\"\nTryouts are a bear. After the initial 600 are trimmed to 120, the group is taught a specific routine. Based on that performance, the group is cut to 65. That begins the final round, when any member of the current squad who wants to try and rejoin is added to the mix. That final group of about 85 goes through a two-day run of routines, interviews and written tests covering everything from current events to Cowboys football. From that group, the final 35 to 40 Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders are chosen.\n\"In that initial phase, when all those ladies are standing up there together, it's intimidating. You get so nervous,\" fourth-year member Amber Gosdin, 27, said. \"But that's what it takes to do this in front of 65,000 people. If you can survive the tryouts, you can survive this.\"\nThe Cowboys cheerleaders aren't pro football's \n original sideline sensations -- that distinction goes to the group that cheered the Baltimore Colts back in the 1940s. \n But the Cowboys' are without question the most popular. The phenomenon started in 1972, when Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm began transforming the franchise from sports to sports entertainment. Sixty girls tried out for the first squad. Seven made it. Four years later, during Super Bowl X, a Cowboys cheerleader winked into the living rooms of 75 million homes. It was love at first sight.\n\"We were the first with this concept of the attractive dancer,\" director Kelli Finglass said. \"The team was winning, and with 'Dallas' the TV show and J.R. Ewing, the city was seen as bigger than life. And we had the perfect mix of beauty and talent, we blended right in with that. Everything came together.\"\nToday, the cheerleaders practice some 25 hours per week -- year round -- and get paid $50 for each game appearance. Though there's no cap on age, the oldest Cowboys cheerleader ever was a 36-year-old mother of four. This year, the eldest is 28, the youngest 18. Of the 38 members, three are married and one is engaged. The other 34 are listed as single.\nIn the daytime, they are everything from students and dental assistants to accountants and financial analysts. In the offseason, a select group tours the world, performing everywhere from California to Korea. They perform for everyone from senior citizens in a veteran's hospital to helicopter pilots in the Army.\nPerhaps the biggest challenge is constantly being \"on.\" Smiling, laughing, teasing, flaunting. Looking sexy enough so fans will buy the swimsuit calendar and playing cards, but trying not to slug the fans when they ask what's hidden behind that chest-front bow.\nPhoto requests? Never ending.\nMarriage proposals? Constant.\n\"It might be awkward for some of the younger girls, but it becomes second nature,\" Gosdin said. \"It's all in good-natured fun.\"\nGosdin handles the role just about perfectly. After all, there she was after Monday's Cowboys trouncing, late in returning to the cheerleaders' locker room, when an Eagles fan in a wheelchair stopped her, asking for a photo. She stopped, put her arm around him, leaned forward and smiled. Flash.\n\"How about one with just you?\" he asked.\nShe stepped back, put her pompon-filled hands on her hips, flipped on her cute and innocent look and smiled. Flash.\n\"How about one with the camera sideways?\" he asked, seriously.\n\"Not a problem,\" she said in a soft, courteous tone. \"But just one -- then I've got to head to the locker room. I'm running a little behind.\"\nIt's never easy.\n\"It takes a special personality,\" Gosdin said. \"And you either have that or you don't. It's the ultimate prerequisite.

The game was at Auburn.\n\"Like they're going to listen to him,\" Accorsi said with a laugh. \"He was cool. Took them all the way down and scored. He's phlegmatic, almost, when it comes to pressure.\"\nEssential for someone in Manning's position, one as unique as there has ever been, even among the quarterbacks who share his draft status. And though it didn't seem possible, the already great expectations for the third Manning, who will make his first career start Sunday against Atlanta, have been heightened because of the instant success of the 11th pick, Pittsburgh's \n. It comes with the territory of being taken at the top of the draft.\nQuarterback is football's marquee position. There's always great pressure to excel. It's the nature of the position. Combine the responsibilities of leading a franchise with the distinction of heading up an entire draft and the corresponding contract and you have a 20-something\n working under circumstances perhaps unlike any in all of sports. A quarterback chosen in the first round already is under excessive scrutiny, and the glare of the spotlight intensifies exponentially for the ones taken No. 1 overall. There's equal pressure on the team's decision makers to justify their investment.\n\"There's just a tremendous amount of pressure on that guy,\" said former Broncos and Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who coached two quarterbacks who were taken first overall, John Elway and \n. \"They watch everything they do. They write about it, they know what cereal they ate for breakfast, what candy they gave out for Halloween. There's always a comparison of the guys in that class, particularly the ones taken high.\"\nBeing the first overall draft pick is like finishing first in a graduating class -- the initial choice is considered to have been the best and, therefore, most likely to succeed in the pros. Drafts often are identified by a player's success or failure. Only merely succeeding, especially when said player is a quarterback, isn't good enough. He must achieve stardom. The Eli Mannings of the league carry the greatest of expectations even though they usually have to meet them playing for the worst team from the previous season.\nThe 14 who have been taken first overall in the 35 drafts since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger are a unique group within the fraternity of pro quarterbacks. This exclusive club has added six No. 1s in the past seven years including the last four, beginning with Atlanta's Vick and continuing with Houston's \n, Cincinnati's \n, and Manning. The top pick might have the total package, but it is imperative that he be handled properly, else he be broken and forced to put his career back together elsewhere.\nIt's different strokes for different folks. Manning backed up \n for the first nine games and attempted just nine passes. Palmer, the Bengals' starter, did not take a snap as a rookie.Since the merger, he was the only quarterback taken first overall to debut in his second season. Carr started the first game in Texans history and is close to achieving elite status. Vick played in eight games as a rookie, starting two, then made the Pro Bowl his first season as a full-time starter and is one of sports' biggest stars.\n\"It's very delicate,\" said Floyd Reese, the Titans' executive vice president and general manager. Tennessee's \n was the third player, but the first quarterback, taken in the '95 draft.\n\"The problem,\" Reese continued, \"is when you have an opportunity to draft someone that high, it probably means your season before probably wasn't that good, and now you think this kid that has just graduated from college, who is 22 or 23 years old, is going to come in and save the franchise. Well that's just unrealistic.\"\nThough not impossible. Two of the 14 quarterbacks taken first overall, Terry Bradshaw (1970) and Elway (1983), are in the Hall of Fame and won six Super Bowls between them with their original teams. \n (1989), who should join them in Canton, Ohio, in two years, was a three-time Super Bowl winner with the Cowboys. \n (1998), another future Hall of Famer, has piled up the victories, but is still seeking his first title.\nAs for the others, \n ('87) and \n ('93) are nearing the ends of solid careers. Jim Plunkett ('71), Steve Bartkowski ('75), and \n ('90) each had a few good seasons in otherwise average careers. Plunkett and George, like the ageless Testaverde, finished their careers with different franchises than the ones that drafted them.\nThe only bust of the bunch is \n, the top pick and first of five quarterbacks chosen in the first round of the 1999 draft. Couch, along with two other members of the QB class of '99, is out of the league after five years.While his game might be flawed, Couch's and the Browns' colossal failure underscores the importance of a viable supporting cast. That's why Roethlisberger, 7-0 as the Steelers' starter, is being hailed as perhaps the best rookie quarterback since Dan Marino in 1983. Contracts aside, quarterbacks taken later often have it better at the beginning than the guys who go earlier. It helps that teams can afford to play them later, i.e. \n.\n\"What happens with these young guys is they come in, they barely have learned their offense, they certainly don't know anything about NFL defenses, and they come in and they get hit harder than they've ever been in their life,\" Reese said. \"They don't know where it came from, if it was a blitz or somebody missed a protection. Until you really know your offense and until you at least have an idea of NFL defenses and what's going on, how do you learn anything constructive?\"\nEli Manning's transition to starter is going almost exactly according to plan. Accorsi had said that he wanted Manning's progression to mirror not that of his brother, Peyton, who has started all 104 games of his career, but that of Marino, who made his first start in October 1983. \"If you were to write the book, that's the way to write it,\" Accorsi said.\nMarino suggested to the Giants that Manning sit to start his career.\nAccorsi also consulted, among others, Bengals president Mike Brown and Colts president Bill Polian for insight as to how they developed Palmer and Peyton Manning, respectively. But that was simply diligence on the part of Accorsi, who merely needed to draw on his own experience for answers.\n\"I saw, my second year in the league, Plunkett played right away and just get clobbered,\" Accorsi said. \"The Patriots just weren't very good. Look how long it took him to eventually resurrect his career. I saw Bert Jones with [the Colts] start in the beginning and we had to get him out of there. I saw Elway come in and really struggle. [Denver] played us twice that year and they had to get him out of the first game and Steve DeBerg came in and beat us. The second game they pulled him out and put him back in. Almost everybody struggles.\"\nReeves made the choice to start Elway, whom the Broncos acquired in a forced trade with Accorsi's Colts, immediately, but had to give him the hook after a few games because he was so bad.\n\"John played really, really well in the preseason,\" Reeves recalled. \"The thing I didn't know, and I had never played a young quarterback, that defenses get much more complicated for them in the regular season. The language is so difficult, the terminology. Back then, before you could talk to the quarterback, he would have to listen to the play from someone else, put the formation with it, then call it in the huddle, and by the time he got up to the line of scrimmage, the clock would be going down to five, four, and he's just trying to get it off. He didn't have a chance to look at the defense and assess it and anticipate it. We benched him, and when he came back later, he was better.\"\nWhen Reeves got Vick, also via trade, this time with the Chargers, he made certain not to make the same mistake. Plus the Falcons, like this year's Giants with Manning, didn't want to compromise competitiveness in order to develop their young quarterback. \"Until you get to the point where you can't win, it's not fair to your football team,\" Reeves said. \"When they work each week, they want the best opportunity to win. You can fool a lot of people, but you can't fool those players.\"\nVick, 20 years old when he was drafted, watched \n for most of his first year and didn't take over as the starter until the final two games. The next year, the Falcons turned him loose, having changed their offensive terminology from verbiage-based to digital so Vick could visualize routes and manage the huddle.\n\"It's hard to keep a thoroughbred in the barn when he's ready to run,\" said Redskins quarterback coach Jack Burns, Vick's tutor his first two years. Burns said the Falcons' public relations staff managing Vick's potentially overwhelming off-field obligations allowed him to devote most of his energies to football. That's key, because everyone seemingly wants a piece of No. 1.\nReeves said he believes it's best for young quarterbacks to get a piece of the action, not watch it.\n\"I may have made a mistake starting John too early,\" he said. \"But he got there quicker because he was out there. Mike Vick didn't start getting better by observing, he got better being on the field. Ben Roethlisberger is better because he's been on the field. But what you don't want to do is put them out there when they're not ready and hurt their progress. If John hadn't been as tough as he was mentally, I could have destroyed him. So there's a thin line there.\"\nWhen formulating his plan for Palmer, Bengals coach Marvin Lewis paid particular attention to how Atlanta handled Vick, who before starting the last two games, played mostly at the end of games, and appeared in only one of the first six road games. Lewis, more intent on developing a winning environment in Cincinnati than the Bengals' future quarterback, wanted to be selective with what situations he put Palmer in, but the way the season played out, the \"right\" time never came and Palmer ended up getting no time.\n\"I wish we would have had the lead in some games, but it just didn't work out that way,\" Lewis said. \"It wasn't our plan that he didn't see the field.\"\nIn the meantime, the Bengals maximized Palmer's preparation time. Lewis extended Thursday and Friday practices just to give Palmer reps. And Palmer was responsible for presiding over the quarterbacks' Saturday meeting, as if he were the starter.\n\"This league and this position can be so mentally draining on you,\" said Palmer, the league's 30th-ranked quarterback with a 66.0 quarterback rating. \"It can just wear you out. But I know what Tuesdays and Wednesdays are like, I know what the Thursday practice is like, I know what it's like to come in Saturday morning for walk-through and you've got family in town.\"\nPalmer, though he missed having all eyes on him, said he can see, in hindsight, that it was better for him to watch and learn as much as possible before dealing with the inevitable growing pains. \"We had a quarterback that could win games, and he did a great job,\" Palmer said. \"I definitely wouldn't have been able to perform as well as (\n) did. With a lot of guys, there isn't another great quarterback in front of them. They've gotta get in there and play.\"\n\nThat was the case with Carr and the expansion Texans three years ago. Houston failed early on in its attempts to acquire a viable veteran and didn't sign a newcomer until bringing in \n in late August. Subsequently, starting Carr was the team's best option.\nIt was similar to the situation in Cleveland three years earlier when Carr's quarterback coach, Chris Palmer, was head coach of the expansion Browns. After the first game, a 43-0 loss to Pittsburgh, Palmer decided to go with Couch over \n. Six years earlier, Palmer had been a member of the Patriots' coaching staff when New England drafted Bledsoe and, by the second month of his rookie season, he was playing ahead of Scott Secules.\nCarr took every offensive snap as a rookie in 2002 and suffered through the worst year ever for a quarterback in terms of sacks, as he was taken down a league-record 76 times. But some good came out of Carr getting beat up. He grew along with the Texans, as did their respect for their leader.\nIndeed, it takes a mentally and physically tough individual to withstand all the criticism, comparisons, \"could-have-hads\" and collisions on the way to meeting the often unreachable expectations that come with being chosen with the first pick of the NFL draft.\n\"It's kind of like a unique little fraternity,\" Carr said. \"I've talked to Troy Aikman. We've both gone through the same things. He's already been through and been to the places I want to go with my team. John Elway and I, we have the same marketing agent, so I've spent some time with him. It's neat to talk to the those guys because you see that if you work hard enough and you keep believing and trusting, that you're going to be all right, you can hopefully be in the same position some day.\n\"Troy told me to just make sure that when your team is ready to go to the playoffs and start winning football games that you're ready as a player to take them there. That's something I still remember. I passed it on to Carson. Hopefully it helps him out.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=smith_michael&id=1924249"},
{"title": "Manning hit the ground running", "text": "\nTo come in, be handed the playbook on draft day, become the starting quarterback by the end of your first mini-camp\n and take every snap as a rookie is mind boggling. But to start 111 straight games (including postseason) to begin your career, and mature to the point that by your seventh season you're in line to repeat as the league's most valuable player, well, you'd have to say \n is one of a kind.\nWhich means he's kind of The One.\nManning, taken first in the 1998 draft out of Tennessee, hit the ground running and hasn't stopped, taking a flawed Colts team along for the ride. None of the great ones and none of the No. 1s can boast that. Not \n. Not John Elway. Not the new \"best rookie QB ever,\" \n, who debuted in his second game and proceeded to win his first seven starts.\nThe closest thing to Manning is Marino, but his Hall-of-Fame career took five games to get going. Because of his career path, Manning has become the standard for the draft's top-selected quarterbacks.\nThe Giants hope they have the next Peyton Manning in his younger brother, No. 1 overall pick Eli, who will make his first career start Sunday against Atlanta. Both practically were reared in the NFL: Eli was in high school when Peyton became a pro and Peyton was a regular presence around the Vikings during the final years of father Archie's career.\n\"He didn't come into the league in awe of the players,\" Pittsburgh receivers coach Bruce Arians, Peyton's first quarterback coach, said. \"He had been in locker rooms his whole life.\"\n\n\"Most of the guys that come in and start that way don't end up that way. They end up with another team at some point in time,\" said Floyd Reese, the Titans' executive vice president and general manager. \"But he and Dan Marino were the guys who were able to start as rookies, perform as rookies, but play at an elite level and are still doing it. What [Manning] has done so far as been uncanny.\"\nAdded Reese: \"You go through the top handful of quarterbacks. \n didn't play for [one year]. \n didn't really play [until the latter part of his rookie year]. Our guy [\n] didn't play for at least a year. You go through and get down to Peyton and you say, well, really Peyton is the one that came in and started right off the bat. The rest of them, one or two things happen. They either wait around to play or they go in, play, get hurt, get discouraged, lose games, get traded to another club, and then play pretty well.\"\nManning endured his share of struggles early on; he threw three interceptions in three of his first four games. In his first three games, against division opponents Miami, New England and the Jets, Manning threw two touchdowns to eight picks. But despite finishing his first season with a 3-13 mark, he established rookie league records with 575 attempts, 326 completions, 3,739 yards (the first of six straight 3,000-yard seasons to begin his career, also a record), 26 touchdowns, and a touchdown pass in 13 straight games.\n\n\"When we went through the division the first time, he was so frustrated,\" Arians recalled. \"The second time through was a different story.\"\nSaid Manning, \"I learned a lot in Weeks 10 and 12, more than I did in Weeks 1 and 2.\"\nWhat impressed Dan Reeves, Elway's first coach in Denver, most was the way Manning handled defensive pressure. Manning was sacked only 22 times as a rookie, 13 coming in three games.\n\"He came in and they didn't win, but the way he took control from Day 1 and hasn't missed a game, and he's taken some shots, that's the amazing thing to me,\" Reeves said. \"It goes to show you how much he studied. It goes to show you that he really had a grasp, because he threw a lot in college.\"\nHe throws a lot, period. Manning always has had a coach's work ethic. Arians recalls him constantly throwing on the side with receivers, almost never taking a break.\n\"He took every rep in practice,\" Arians said. \"Still does, I think. The backup quarterback there doesn't get any snaps. His work ethic was unbelievable.\"\nArians said Manning in '98 was a lot like the Roethlisberger we're watching now, a poised quarterback who didn't take off and run at the first sign of pressure, but always kept his eyes downfield, always looking to make a play.\nArians was put on the spot: Who was the better of the record-breaking rookies he coached: Manning or Roethlisberger?\n\"Peyton's the best one I've ever coached,\" Arians said. \"But I'm not coaching Ben.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=smith_michael&id=1924396"},
{"title": "Wolf found the QBs, Walsh developed them", "text": "\nWith a r√©sum√© spanning three decades of evaluations, and a track record of selections including Doug Williams, Steve Young and \n, former longtime NFL personnel director Ken Herock knows something about choosing and developing quarterbacks.\nPart of what he knows: \"You want winners, definitely, tough-minded guys. But you still have to start with the physical stuff because, without that, you are not going to get very far. You can talk about the 'quarterback development' guys. But, in the NFL, they have to have a talent base from which to work. I mean, you simply can't develop guys who are just stiffs, you know?\"\nTrue enough, the NFL forum isn't a Broadway stage, and the men charged with nurturing and refining quarterbacks aren't exactly Henry Higgins mentoring Eliza Doolittle. The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain? In the NFL, the reign of terror falls more often on the head of the quarterback ill-prepared for the rigors of the position, and on those who don't possess the level of inherent skills necessary for a successful tutorial process.\nYou can, recent history has indicated, forge a quarterback. What one can't do, it seems, is create the clay that goes into the mold. The first difficulty is in assaying the quality of the natural resource. The second is in enhancing that excellence before it goes into the kiln.\nFor the first step there have been few better over the past quarter-decade than Ron Wolf, best known for his tenure as the Green Bay general manager, but a personnel evaluator whose eyesight for judging quarterback talent was deemed 20/20 long before joining the Packers. As for refining that talent, nudging it to the next level, former San Francisco coach Bill Walsh may be unparalleled.\nThere is a burgeoning forest of so-called \"quarterback guys\" that has sprung from the Walsh family tree -- Mike Holmgren, Dennis Green, Steve Mariucci, Andy Reid, Bruce Coslet, Brian Billick, Jon Gruden, Sam Wyche, among them -- but the progenitor of the fraternity remains the dean of development.\nIt's easy to recall the work Walsh performed with Joe Montana and Steve Young in San Francisco, the former already in the Hall of Fame, the latter likely to be chosen for that honor in about two months. But the Walsh school of finishing also included lessons with another Hall of Fame passer, Dan Fouts, for one year in San Diego. And former Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson, among the 90 candidates on this year's preliminary Hall of Fame ballot, is another onetime Walsh prot√©g√©.\nEverywhere he went, it seems, Walsh had a Svengalian gift for getting inside the heads of the quarterbacks with whom he worked. He didn't actively pull the strings nearly as much as, say, Steve Spurrier at Florida, where the former Heisman Trophy winner still wanted to play the position himself, almost as if by osmosis. Obviously, the hands-on Spurrier could not apply those skills at the NFL level. Walsh, though, didn't suffer such failures.\n\"I think everyone we had,\" Walsh said, \"was able to connect physical skills with the mental part of the game. They had a knack for applying the things they learned during quarterback meetings or in quarterback 'skull sessions,' and taking it to the field. You get a lot of credit for developing those things. But, really, all you're doing is merging gifts they already had with the (West Coast) system. You work on detail, refine some things, maybe raise the level some. But they have to come to you with something that's already in them.\"\nModesty has never been a Walsh strong suit but, in this case, he might be oversimplifying his role. No one from the Walsh coaching tree, with as many quarterbacks as his disciples have developed, have enjoyed his degree of success. Holmgren, for instance, is credited with the maturation of Favre, but can't seem to steady his starting quarterback, \n, right now. Mariucci, who got the job in Detroit, in large part because it was believed he could accelerate the learning curve for \n, may be forced to soon bench his ineffective starter. Reid did a nice job maintaining Favre, and has nurtured \n, but hasn't won a title yet.\n\"I think what (Walsh) did in terms of developing guys at the position, well, it won't be matched,\" said Green, who has succeeded despite presiding over a quarterback carousel during his tenure as a head coach. \"He's been the guy.\"\nAt least for this era of the game.\nThe legendary Sid Gillman, acknowledged as the father of the modern passing game, was a brilliant schemer and communicator. And people seem to forget that Paul Brown, more noted as a pioneer in various areas of the game, also hammered home detail and minutiae to his quarterbacks. No one, though, has done it as well as Walsh.\nAnd few have unearthed as many quarterbacks as Wolf, one of the evaluators who never bought into the notion that you can win in the NFL with a lesser talent at the position.\n\"You can never have enough good quarterbacks around,\" said Wolf. \"You're always out there digging, trying to add to the position or replenish it.\"\nNot surprisingly, given their long-standing friendship, Wolf shares the views of Herock on the quarterback position, believing that a player has to possess that certain \n to flourish at the game's most critical spot. And he agrees that, sometimes, you have to get lucky, either projecting a prospect, seeing something in him that perhaps no one else may perceive, or simply falling into a great one.\nThat was the case with Favre, whom Herock was forced to trade only one season after choosing him in the second round of the 1991 draft. Jerry Glanville, then the head coach of the \n, was convinced Favre could never be tamed, and ordered Herock to deal him away. It took one phone call, since Herock and Wolf shared the same opinion of Favre, to strike a deal.\nFor Wolf, who had spent decades assessing quarterback talent, one of the greatest players of all time essentially fell into his lap.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&page=/trend/2004week11"},

{"title": "O-line must protect Manning", "text": "\n \n ABC may have a hit on its hand with the new series \"Lost,\" but the NFL has a one-week glitch in the schedule. Call it \"The Lost Weekend.''\nThirteen winning teams play 13 losing teams, either promoting a weekend of great upsets or predictable outcomes. The only game in which two winning teams meet is at Giants Stadium where the Giants host the Falcons.\nThat game became even more interesting with Giants coach Tom Coughlin's decision to start rookie quarterback \n. The Falcons have a hard-to-overcome three-game lead in the NFC South and the confidence of watching quarterback \n grow each week as the leader of the team.\nAt 7-2, the Falcons should cruise down the stretch into the playoffs. The Giants, meanwhile, are in crisis mode, so the decision to go with Manning is an interesting one.\nIn many ways, Coughlin didn't have a choice. Since their impressive win over the Vikings three weeks ago, the Giants have lost two games in a row. The offensive line had allowed 24 sacks in four games, and the next five games feature the four best sacking defenses and the Redskins, who have the most aggressive blitzing scheme in the league.\nWith \n continuing to hold onto the ball too long, Coughlin knew keeping him at quarterback was only going to heighten the sack numbers and further slow down the offense. The decision was only partly based on Warner's play, though. The sack problems are a team failure -- not a Warner failure. Left tackle \n is having a horrible season protecting the quarterback because of a sore back and a recent concussion. Overall, the team has allowed a league-high 40 sacks.\nAnother problem is that the receivers aren't getting open. Warner has had to hold onto the ball until \n and others broke into the clear and that had become increasingly more difficult each week. Still, benching a veteran quarterback with Super Bowl experience in favor of a rookie is tricky and could backfire.\nWith Warner, the Giants are 5-4 and in the wild-card hunt. Even though he's fumbled way too much, Warner has thrown only four interceptions. Except for the fumbles, he's done a good job of protecting the ball.\nManning does bring a quick release and the smarts of the Manning family, which has yet to fail on any level of football. Archie Manning, his father, was a Hall-of-Fame caliber quarterback on horrible Saints teams. \n is arguably the league's best quarterback and on the verge of breaking numerous passing and scoring records in his seventh season.\nThe Eli Manning Era begins at an interesting time. It comes during the toughest part of the Giants schedule. Four of the next five games are against winning teams. If Manning can survive this, he will become a rookie sensation.\nIf not, he may find himself high in the sack totals like his predecessor, Warner.\n \n With \n sidelined because of a hamstring pull, the Steelers are riding The Bus to make \n's job easier. \n has filled in for Staley with back-to-back 100-yard games and figures to follow the game plan if Staley can't play. Like a year ago, the Bengals are getting their second wind in the second half of the season, but the question is how much their defense has improved since their 28-17 loss in Pittsburgh on Oct. 3? Stopping the run is their problem. They are the third-worst rushing defense, allowing 142.7 yards a game. Both teams are banged up with long injury lists, and at some point, you figure the Steelers will start to feel the effects of those injuries. In fact, this could be the game the Steelers could be tested at nose tackle. \n has done a nice job filling in for Pro Bowl nose tackle \n, who is out of the season with a knee injury. \n is the Bengals' no-nonsense inside runner. He hits those inside holes quickly and with efficiency. Johnson is 10th in the league with 785 yards on 206 carries. Without Hampton, the Steelers defense has been playing with decent first-half leads and haven't had to worry a lot about the opponent's ground game. Because opposing offenses have been so far behind, they have been forced to pass. With a division rivalry on the line, this could figure to be a much closer game if the Bengals can do something to stop the run. Roethlisberger is trying to go 8-0 as a starter in his rookie season.\n \n Last week in defeat, the Vikings proved their offense can do well without \n. \n passed for 363 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers. In fact, the Vikings tied the score against two playoff-caliber teams on the road in the fourth quarter before eventually losing on late field goals at Indianapolis and Green Bay. Now, the Vikings return home to play a Lions team that has suddenly become anemic on offense. The Lions rank last in the league with an offense generating 249.6 yards a game. \n is edging ever closer to being benched, and the fear factor has left the Lions offense now that \n continues to play with an ankle injury that restricts his big-play ability. For the Vikings, this game is critical. A year ago, coach Mike Tice took criticism for a second-half collapse because he lost too many games to teams with losing records. He can't afford to lose to a Lions team that is 4-5 and going south. Moss returns next week, and that will be a big boost to the offense. A win over the Lions would also be a big boost. The Lions are so banged up on defense, it's going to be hard for them to contain Culpepper in the air and when he runs out of the pocket. Since they shouldn't fall behind early as they did against the Colts and Packers, the Vikings can concentrate more on pounding the football on the ground with \n and \n.\n \n Since 1995 when the Rams moved to St. Louis, they are 4-9 in games played in temperatures below 50 degrees. Though it may not be freezing this weekend in Buffalo, wind has to be a concern for the Rams offense. In the past three home games, increasingly bad winds have restricted offenses playing in Buffalo. St. Louis coach Mike Martz is still cracking the whip by having the team practice in pads and having live hitting Wednesdays, but he still subscribes to a pass-first, run-second philosophy. The Rams passed 13 consecutive times to start the game against the Seahawks and that later opened up things on the ground. The Rams ended up with more than 200 yards rushing against the Seahawks. Of course, the Rams play in the climate-controlled Edward Jones Dome, so it may be tougher to establish the pass if they are throwing into the wind. The Bills have been able to take advantage of the wind conditions and win the past three home games, particularly with \n doing a great job of bouncing off tacklers and establishing the running game. For quarterback \n, this is a crisis week. His bad performance against the Patriots puts him in a position in which he could be benched this week and \n could be given the job soon. The Rams defense was more aggressive against the Seahawks last week, forcing two turnovers. Though the unit hustles to the ball, it had forced just seven turnovers prior to Week 10. The Rams' defensive mission is to put pressure on Bledsoe and force him to make mistakes, but if their run defense -- which has been vulnerable all season -- struggles, they could be in trouble.\n\n\n \n The Packers have won four in a row and are on a roll. Packers coach Mike Sherman can't call a bad play, and \n is in one of his best November throwing rolls. It also doesn't help the Texans that their defense played two of its worst games on the road against the Broncos and the Colts. Still, at home, the Texans have confidence, which could make this a tough game for the Packers. Texans cornerbacks have been affected by the rule adjustment that prohibits contact five yards past the line of scrimmage, and they tend to give up more big plays than expected. The defense also has to worry about the Packers' running offense now that \n has regained his confidence and is putting up big numbers. Green is even trying to run a little bit more with the ball in his right hand because he has been fumbling with his left. Quarterback \n of the Texans has started to drop his delivery a little more sidearm, so he may have to make a mechanical adjustment or two before this game. Houston's Dom Capers is a great coach at motivating and he may be able to use the Packers game as a rallying point. If not, the finish to the Texans' season could be tough.\n \n Maybe the week could pass without \n being involved in some kind of controversy. This might be the week because all eyes will be on the Redskins. Washington coach Joe Gibbs finally changed over to \n at quarterback. \n was so bad that it's been amazing to think Gibbs waited 10 weeks into the season to bench him. Brunell worked an offense that averaged only 14 points a game and his 49.8 completion percentage was embarrassing. Gibbs had enough last week when Brunell was even less accurate on short passes. Brunell was averaging only five yards a pass attempt. \n might be averaging five yards an attempt were it not for the defenders playing closer to the line of scrimmage because they didn't fear Brunell's arm. Maybe the break will give Brunell a better chance at a later time this season, but Ramsey does bring a strong arm and a little energy to the offense. Eagles coach Andy Reid wasn't happy with the defense before their victory over the Cowboys on Monday night and he made a couple changes that worked. \n got more playing time at defensive tackle, taking some time away from \n. \n moved back into his old spot at middle linebacker and his bigger body seemed to help in stopping the run.\n  \n The Bears are talking playoffs even though they are 4-5, but this could be a wakeup call. While the Bears defensive line is coming on strong, they face a quarterback who has been pretty much unstoppable this season. \n has a quarterback rating of 122.7, has been sacked only six times and has thrown only six interceptions. The Bears defense lost its biggest playmaker last week when middle linebacker \n needed surgery for a deep contusion that had too much internal bleeding. He's out 4-6 weeks, and that should open the middle of the field for Manning to pick apart. This is a bad matchup for the Bears. The Colts offense has been the most consistent in football. Manning has produced 37 touchdown drives in 94 possessions. He has 31 touchdown passes and has been impossible to stop in the red zone. The Bears, meanwhile, are scoring more on defensive plays than offense. \n has done a good job of decision-making in his three wins since taking over for the ineffective \n, but he isn't very accurate and doesn't have a very strong arm. If the Colts jump to an early lead, the Bears won't have much of a chance to catch up. The only way they can win is if they can make this a low-scoring game. That will be tough.\n \n Things just get worse for the Titans. They lost left tackle \n and safety \n last week on a team already starving for healthy players. Though there is a good chance \n should return as the starting quarterback this week, the line blocking in front of him might make that dangerous. \n fumbled three times last week and is really struggling with his toe injury. Meanwhile, the Jaguars did a nice job of rallying against the Lions around backup quarterback \n. He threw for two touchdowns, and even though his completion percentage was only slightly above 50 percent, he did a nice job of managing the offense. His arm is strong. He's hard to bring down at 244 pounds, and he's got great quickness for a big quarterback. The Jaguars stunned the Titans early in the season by beating them, 15-12, in Nashville. A loss to a Jaguars team operated by their backup quarterback would only further add to Tennessee's miserable season.\n \n Jets coach Herman Edwards took a lot of criticism this week for not getting in enough plays in the final minutes of regulation in what turned out to be an overtime loss to the Ravens. A loss to the Browns would send Jets fans into pure panic mode. These next three games are vital to the Jets. Their final four games are against teams with combined records of 26-10. Over the next three weeks, the Jets play three losing teams -- the Browns, Cardinals and Texans. Winning those three would keep the critics off them after fading from a 6-1 start with losses the past two weeks against the Bills and Ravens. Jets quarterback \n did a nice job last week. He kept the running game moving, and completing his first eight passes against the Ravens in the first half was impressive. The trick play in which \n tried a halfback option that was intercepted killed momentum after opening a 14-0 lead, so the Jets may stay away from the trickery and concentrate on running the ball with \n. It seems apparent major changes will occur in the Browns organization. Coach Butch Davis acknowledged that the organization is down eight or nine key executives and needs to bring in a bigger brain trust. Owner Randy Lerner wants to hire a general manager, which would take power away from Davis. A loss to the Jets would even further add to the rumors that Davis is in trouble as a head coach after the season.\n\n\n \n The Chargers beat the Raiders three weeks ago 42-14 with halfback \n only at 80 percent because of a groin injury. Tomlinson feels the rest from the bye week has allowed him to return to 100 percent. Suddenly, the Chargers offense is scaring people. Few have had answers for tight end \n. \n has been a big addition, giving \n a possession receiving option. With Tomlinson healthy, the Chargers can play great games with defenses. Gates is so good he almost demands double coverage. But double covering Gates takes away that extra defender to help stop Tomlinson at the line of scrimmage. And here comes the Raiders, who aren't sure if they are a 3-4 or a 4-3. The Raiders are also coming off a bye, so it will be interesting to see what changes they make on defense. Will there be massive changes in starting personnel? Will the Raiders simply switch to a 4-3?\n \n The Broncos regained their swagger with the 31-13 victory over the Texans before the bye week. \n had a four-touchdown game and most importantly didn't thrown any interceptions. He has 19 touchdown passes for the season. \n has rested his body and should be set for a 30-carry game against a defense that is allowing 149 yards a game on the ground. Still, this is a dangerous game for the Broncos. The Saints edged the Chiefs last week at home and could cause problems for the Broncos, who won't have \n at defensive tackle and may or may not have strong safety and leader \n. One worry for the Broncos could be the pass rush with defensive end \n out. Given time, Saints quarterback \n can pick a defense apart, and coach Mike Shanahan hasn't been pleased at some of the big pass plays allowed by the defense. This isn't going to be a Big Easy one for the Broncos.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&page=/ten/2004week11"},

{"title": "Smith has Bears on defensive", "text": "\nEarly word from South Florida is that \n owner Wayne Huizenga prefers his new head coach be one of those high-falutin' offensive-mined guys. Which figures, since ol' Wayne-o suggested this summer that \n could represent the second coming of Dan Marino, and now he needs a guy adept at drawing a bunch of exotic O's up on the grease board if the scatter-armed quarterback is even to resemble Broadway star Rita \n.\nBut if Wayne's World is ever to include winning again, maybe he ought to heed this advice: Search high and low, Wayne, go out and root among the landfills where your waste disposal business helped you bank your first million bucks, and find the best young defensive mind available. The numbers, and recent history, seem to indicate it is the approach that works best.\nSince 2000, there have been 19 rookie head coaches in the NFL, and a dozen of them were sideline bosses whose primary expertise was on the defensive side of the football. Among them are Jim Mora in Atlanta, whose team all but secured a playoff berth on Sunday, and it's only mid-November. John Fox, who took the \n to Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2003, in just his second season. Herman Edwards, who has the \n on pace for a third playoff berth in his first four campaigns. Marvin Lewis, who in his debut 2003 campaign, shepherded the moribund \n to a .500 record. And Jack Del Rio, whose Jacksonville team is definitely choppin' wood this year, minus the oak stump and ax.\nWhich brings us, in a convoluted fashion, to Lovie Smith of the \n. Lovie Smith, you say? Yep, Lovie Smith, we say. He and his team won a third consecutive outing Sunday and, at 4-5, now trail the Packers and Vikings in the suddenly compressed NFC North by only one game. It certainly was fitting that the Bears' defense provided the winning points, with a safety, because the much-overlooked unit has clearly made this bunch competitive.\nHow else to explain three wins with \n, for gosh sakes, at quarterback? The rookie has completed all of 31 passes in his three victories, been sacked an amazing 14 times, and has registered a passer rating of 53.0. That includes an anemic 19.3 rating in Sunday's overtime victory over the \n. Chicago has scored seven touchdowns in The Krenzel Era, but only four of them were by the offense. During the winning streak, the Bears offense has averaged 220.3 yards, or basically a good quarter for the \n.\nUh, yeah, the same Colts who travel to Soldier Field next weekend. Luckily for Da Bears, da defense has permitted a manageable 270.0 yards during the winning skein. Smith has made it work by starting a pair of rookie tackles for most of the season. He lost free safety \n, the unit's leader, for the year. Every one of his cornerbacks have been nicked at some point. \n, whom Smith seemed to think was kind of overrated anyway, began the year with a strained hamstring and really has not been 100 percent healthy yet.\nBut the Bears have unearthed good, young linebackers such as \n and Green Bay reject \n. The secondary has been steadfastly aggressive. Right end \n has become a terror. Left end \n has started to re-establish himself as a pass-rush threat. And of Chicago's five losses, three have been by five points or fewer, with an average losing margin of only 6.8 points.\nThink of where Smith might have this team if starting quarterback \n hadn't gone down with a season-ending knee injury, or if there had been a backup more adequate than \n on the roster, huh? Still, things are going pretty dovey for Lovie, who won't win coach of the year honors, but clearly has demonstrated his resourcefulness and his viability as a guy who was worthy of the job. Wherever the next Lovie Smith is, Wayne Huizenga, you could do worse than to identify him.\nColeman lifts Falcons\n\nSitting in the luxurious Furman University dormitory suite of Rich McKay at camp this summer (so, OK, we fudged a little on the \n part), the \n general manager spoke with us at length of how important it was for the team to land a playmaker at the \"under' tackle spot. So remember now, McKay knows a thing or two about \"under\" tackles, having employed \n at the position during their years together with the Tampa Bay Bucs franchise.\nIn the mind of Bucs defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin and former head coach Tony Dungy -- and that means, in the mind of Rich McKay, too, we're guessing -- you've got to have three positions which feature superior performers. The weak-side linebacker. Strong safety. And, yep, \"under\" tackle, an interior force who aligns in the gap, who can penetrate, who gets into the backfield and wreaks all sorts of havoc and disruption.\nFrom our notes, and McKay's quotes of this summer: \"The nose tackle-type guys, the guys who just plug the middle, you can find them. But 'under' tackles, those are hard to come by, and it's tough to play without them.\" Talk about a self-fulfilling prophesy. Atlanta found a superior \"under' tackle this spring, when it added former \n standout \n as an unrestricted free agent.\nAnd now, nine games into the year, the Falcons know precisely what it means to play \n Coleman and to play \n him in the lineup. Coleman returned on Sunday, in the Falcons' victory over Tampa Bay, after missing three games with shoulder and knee injuries he sustained in the Oct. 16 one-vehicle accident. And we're thinking it wasn't just coincidence that, with Coleman on the field again, Atlanta registered a season-high seven sacks. Despite being triple-teamed at times, Coleman had two sacks, giving him six in six appearances this year.\nLeft end \n, who had seven sacks in his first four games but had gone four games without a sack (including all three contests in which Coleman was sidelined), got back in the sack column again.\nWant some number-crunching? In the six games Coleman played, the Falcons have allowed an average of 276.5 yards and 13.3 points, totaled 25 sacks and registered 12 takeaways. Four times in those games, the defense held opponents to less than 300 yards, and three times the Falcons unit permitted fewer than 250 yards. Atlanta didn't permit more than 20 points in any of those contests.\nIn the three games Coleman missed, the defense surrendered an average of 475 yards and 34.7 points, recorded one measly sack and five takeaways. Opponents scored 20 or more points in all three of those outings and that included 84 points the past two weeks.\nNot that we didn't buy into Rich McKay's sermon this summer about the significance of the \"under' tackle spot. But if anyone needed graphic evidence -- and McKay, by trade, is an attorney -- it was more than sufficiently provided with Coleman as Exhibit A.\nThat time of year in Minnestoa\n\nTell the truth now. Even after Minnesota tailback \n scored on a 17-yard pass, much of it incredible individual effort, to tie the score at 31-31 against \n with 1:20 remaining at Lambeau Field on Sunday, you still knew the Vikings were going down again, didn't you?\nEven after Packers return man \n fumbled the ensuing kickoff into a sea of Minnesota coverage players, all of them around the ball, you knew some unknown Green Bay bench jockey  (in this case, \n, a onetime practice squad guy) was going to burrow to the bottom of the pile and pry the thing lose, right?\nAnd why, folks, did you know these things?\nBecause, alas, it's Death Gurgle Time for the Vikings again, that's how. Give the Vikings and coach Mike Tice credit for summoning up the will to storm back with two late-game touchdowns and overcome a 14-point hole in the closing minutes. But in the NFL, you've got to close out wins, and when the Vikes get to the most critical part of the season, they simply can't perform that crucial function.\nThat's three straight losses for Minnesota, the last two of them with \n standing on the sideline with his balky hamstring, wishing he could help. Think this streak doesn't conjure up visions of the 2003 collapse, in which Minnesota opened 6-0 then missed the playoffs by losing seven of its last 10, for the Vikings player who suffered that ignominy?\nYeah, they may say last season doesn't impact on this year, but it's got to be stuck pretty good in their craniums. Remember the 1980s movie \"The China Syndrome,\" the flick starring Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas, and in which a nuclear reactor suffers a catastrophic event? It was so named because, in fission-talk, if a reactor fails and the core rods are exposed, the theory is that the unit will melt down into the Earth. You know, all the way to China, on the other side.\nWell, the Vikings better get straightened out real soon, or better get their passports handy. A few more defeats and the Vikings are going to be eating with chop-sticks, in some Beijing rice house, pretty darned soon.\n\nInconsistent in Seattle\n\nThe good news for the Vikings is that they could have some travel companions in the Orient if the \n don't get back to the way they played in the first three weeks of the season. The Seahawks lost for the fourth time in six weeks, and the second time to the \n, as their own meltdown continued on Sunday.\nIn the first defeat, St. Louis scored 17 points in 5¬Ω minutes to overcome a huge deficit and force overtime. On Sunday, the Rams scored 17 points in the opening 17&189; minutes, jumping out to a big advantage they did not relinquish.\nEven through their first couple defeats, we felt the Seahawks were still a solid club, the best in the division. But, boy, has our perspective changed. Even some Seattle coaches concede this is a flawed team, and who are we to argue?\nSeattle fans fret that the team could lose \n in free agency after the season but, given his recent stretch, how bad can that really be? Hot as a pistol in the first three games, Hasselbeck has now had three outings in which he has thrown 20-plus incompletions. On Sunday, he was 15 for 36 for 172 yards and zero touchdown passes. And that's against a St. Louis defense that has been surrendering both yards and points in scads.\nTailback \n, another pending free agent and a player on whom the Seahawks coaches aren't universally sold, rushed for 176 yards. No matter, though, since neither he nor any of his teammates can move the ball in the red zone. Five trips inside the St. Louis 20-yard line, four \n field goals, and that isn't going to cut it.\nRams coach Mike \"The Mastermind\" Martz opened the game with 13 straight pass plays, the Seahawks were knocked back on their heels (perhaps by the sheer predictability of that gambit), and Seattle never recovered. Seattle has a relatively easy schedule coming up and, even with two losses to the Rams, that might provide coach Mike Holmgren and his team a slight edge. But the Seahawks have become every bit as roller coaster a bunch as their NFC West counterparts, every bit as inconsistent as the Rams, and that's hardly what you aspire to be.\n\nSuccessful audition\n\nWinning their first outing minus injured starter \n, even if it took overtime to accomplish it, was a nice accomplishment for the \n, one that kept them tied for first in the AFC South.\nWinning his first start as the replacement was pretty big, too, for quarterback \n.\nA couple of old hands accustomed to big games, wide receiver \n (seven catches, 109 yards, the game-winning 36-yard grab in overtime) and tailback \n (23 carries for 144 yards), provided great support for Garrard.\nBut just as we had anticipated, the third-year veteran acquitted himself well, and passed his first audition for some other team. Some other team? Yeah, because at some point, the Jaguars are going to decide that Garrard is a talented quarterback who can bring them something in return. He's never going to oust Leftwich from the starting job, at least not anytime soon, and Garrard (19 for 36, 198 yards, two touchdown, no interceptions) is very highly regarded in some NFL precincts.\nIf you can, watch Garrard next week, and then take a mental inventory of the quarterback-needy franchises for which he could likely start in 2005. One of them, Detroit, got a first-hand look at Garrard on Sunday. Yeah, we said Detroit, where \n (an abysmal 11-for-33 performance) has now sunk below inconsistent. Detroit brass has surrounded Harrington with enough talent that he is running out of excuses, as the Lions run out of time and patience.\nWhen we saw Garrard in training camp last summer, it was obvious he had progressed immensely, had worked through many of the deficiencies of his rookie season. The good news for some team is that Garrard, diagnosed with Crohn's disease this past summer, continues to blossom and he's going to become someone's solid starter. He is over his old, rookie-year habit of abandoning the pocket too soon, displays nice awareness, doesn't try to force the action and is simply a very poised young man. So, on Sunday, both he and the Jaguars were big winners.\nPunts\n\nTennessee coach Jeff Fisher is now 0-3 lifetime versus the Bears, the franchise with which he played five seasons (1981-85) as a defensive back. ... In its six losses, Kansas City has averaged an amazing 378.2 yards of offense. That's about 20 yards more than winning teams have averaged on offense through the first 10 weeks of the season. Such largesse helps explain a loss like Sunday's in which the Chiefs had a 300-yard passer, a tailback who ran for nearly 200 yards and a 100-yard receiver. ... The Bears' victory on Sunday marked just the second time a team had won in overtime on a safety. ... Indianapolis' win on Sunday pushed the Colts to 82-81 at home since the club moved from Baltimore in 1984. It is the first time the Colts have been over .500 at the RCA Dome (nee Hoosier Dome). ... Carolina punter \n had to handle the placement chores Sunday after kicker \n sustained a calf injury. ... Atlanta used quarterback \n more in the shotgun Sunday than at any time during the season, it seemed, and the gambit worked well. Vick looked fairly comfortable and made good reads. Meanwhile, one has to wonder the last time a team made the playoffs without a wide receiver who had 50 catches. The Falcons are headed that way. ... Buffalo rookie quarterback J.P. Losman, the latter of the Bills' two first-rounders, got his regular-season debut on Sunday evening. With the Bills all but eliminated from the playoffs, and \n no lock to be back in 2005, Losman could get a few starts in the second half of the season, now that he has rehabilitated from a broken leg. ... In the Friday \"Tip Sheet,\" we made the best line matchup of the week the battle between \n left offensive tackle \n and \n right defensive end Bertrand Berry. The winner in a landslide, Berry, who had four sacks. Petitgout is clearly hurting and might need some time off. In the last two weeks, opposition right ends have recorded eight sacks against the Giants. In the last four games now, \n has been sacked an incredible 24 times. The only plus on Sunday was that Warner didn't fumble or turn the ball over. ... Cornerback \n, acquired from Green Bay via trade, had his first interception Sunday for the \n. ... Pressed into service as a punter, after a shoulder injury to \n, backup quarterback \n added another element to his \"Slash\" lineage. He punted five times for an average of 35.4 yards gross and 31.2 yards net, with two kicks inside the 20-yard line. ... Pittsburgh tailback \n had two more touchdown runs on Sunday, giving him 10 for the season, and earning him a $100,000 incentive. His 10 touchdown runs have totaled just 19 yards and his five-yarder on Sunday was his longest of the season. Five scores have come from one yard.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&page=/morning/week10"},

Weathersby lost nearly half of his blood volume in the incident and, once projected as a second-round prospect, saw his draft stock plummet.\nBengals officials viewed Weathersby as a steal in the fourth round, and still considered him a potential long-term starter, but he spent much of that spring rehabilitating from his wounds and reported to camp out of shape. After playing catch-up in his conditioning, Weathersby appeared in only four games as a rookie, but Bengals officials still felt he could challenge for considerable playing time this season.\nThat was before Weathersby lost control of his Impala SS on a rain-slicked interstate in April, with his car spinning and eventually colliding with a utility pole. Unconscious at the scene, Weathersby was transported to Springdale, then eventually taken via helicopter to University Hospital in Cincinnati, where he spent two months.\nHe has never conceded, even in ensuing months, that his head injury was life-threatening. But certainly it was serious enough to be career-threatening.\nWeathersby, 24, is going to make sure, though, that if doctors eventually clear him to get back on a football field, his body is prepared for the challenge. He has been working out in Cincinnati, strengthening a damaged shoulder that was surgically repaired before his car accident, and trying to maintain a consistent level of conditioning.\nSeven months after the accident, five months into Weathersby's rehabilitation, there are still no real guarantees from doctors. The Bengals, who once mentally penciled him into the lineup for the future, signed veteran corner \n last spring, traded for \n this summer and are getting solid play in the secondary from a pair of rookies.\nHe is out of sight on the depth chart, and if not yet out of the mind of head coach Marvin Lewis, still a long shot even if doctors allow him to attend training camp next summer. But Weathersby, who still experiences some aftereffects from his head injury, is leaving nothing to chance.\n\"It's still too early in this whole [ordeal],\" he said this week, \"to think about something other than football.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1925762"},

{"title": "Cowboys get old at wrong positions", "text": "\nTeams that play with too much age are playing with fire.\nLoading up with aging veteran starters can provide the leadership necessary to turn a good team into a great team. Look at the Patriots. They've patented the processes. Bill Belichick knows the value of role players and loves to fill out key positions with veterans.\nLast year, he added cornerback \n, safety \n, defensive tackle \n and won his second Super Bowl in three years. The Patriots entered the 2003 season as the league's oldest team with an average age of 27.91, the oldest since the start of the new millennium.\nBut while the Patriots brought in all those veterans, what got lost in the equation was a good draft that restocked the team with \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\nAge can singe teams, too. Seven of the nine oldest teams this year have losing records. Last year, five of the eight oldest teams were losers. In 2002, the number was seven out of nine. In 2000, four of the top five oldest teams didn't make the playoffs.\nPersonnel isn't a simple job anymore. Actually, it never was, but the job is getting tougher in the salary cap age and it makes the idea of coach-general manager prehistoric. The salary cap punishes a team for bad free agent mistakes. Cap planning for the future pulls head coaches out of the day-to-day thinking that is needed to win games. \"One-game-at-a-time\" doesn't work in personnel because teams always have to look ahead.\nAnd the urgency to look ahead is even more important on older teams because the dropoff can be rapid. The Raiders are a classic example. In 2002, they were tied with Detroit as the league's second oldest team with an average age of 27.5, just behind the Chiefs. Since their Super Bowl loss to the Bucs at the end of that season, their record is 7-18.\nOlder teams require bolder decisions. Belichick stays ahead of the curve because he and vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli constantly churn their roster. The Patriots got younger after winning the Super Bowl with the league's oldest team, falling from an average age of 27.9 to 27.23. They got one great starter out of the draft, defensive tackle \n. They made one of the steals of the offseason in getting a Pro Bowl caliber halfback, Corey Dillon, from the Bengals.\nMost scouts will tell you the most important positions are -- in no particular order -- quarterback, defensive end, left tackle, wide receiver, cornerback and running back. The key is not getting older at these key positions. Getting younger with bad players isn't the answer either, but getting older with bad players is even worse.\nLook at the \n. On the age scale, they're pretty good. They actually were the league's 12th youngest team entering the season with an average age of 26.40. But whether it was Bill Parcells or Jerry Jones making the decisions, here's where they went wrong.\nThey got older and less effective at running back replacing \n with \n (31). All right, Hambrick isn't that great and the team needed an upgrade. He rushed for just 972 yards on 275 carries. But with rookie Julius Jones getting hurt (broken shoulder blade), George and \n (33), two aging veterans, have left the Cowboys with no running threat. At defensive end, \n (29) is older and has been less effective than the departed \n, who wasn't signed because he didn't make enough plays. Wiley, who signed for $4 million a year, hardly makes any plays and isn't even used on passing downs.\nThe Cowboys got older at quarterback with \n (41) replacing \n. They got older and slower at wide receiver. They didn't do anything to replace \n at cornerback. It's no wonder the Cowboys are floundering at 3-6. They basically got worse, older and slower at five of the key areas of the team. That's playing with fire.\nBelichick didn't let that happen in New England. He made sure he had a good, young left tackle in \n and locked him up with a long-term contract extension. He's been drafting heavy along the defensive line for three years and has a good young group of linemen. There is age at cornerback, but two of last year's top draft choices -- Wilson and Samuel -- were drafted as cornerbacks, so he has youth there if he wants it.\nEach year, the free agency pool for good young players grows smaller because teams are doing a better job of managing the cap and keeping their core group of players. It's placing a bigger importance on building through the draft and making it tougher to build through free agency.\nThat's where the Redskins keep missing the point. Dan Snyder is a big free agency player. Since the start 2000, he's consistently put together one of the NFL's oldest teams. In 2000, he had the oldest team. He was ninth in 2001 and 2002 and 11th last year. This year, he's third with an average age of 27.49.\nThough he's usually gotten one or two good starters out of the draft, Snyder has filled the rest of his roster with high-priced veterans. No wonder he's on his fourth coach in Joe Gibbs. Snyder is looking for instant impact from the offseason. The problem is going with veterans can burn a franchise and leave it old.\n was an old quarterback and played like it through nine games. Though that was Gibbs' decision, it didn't work. Washington's payroll soared above $110 million and unless there are changes during the offseason, they'll have the league's oldest team next year. Sure, the \n trade worked. \n, \n and \n were good signings. But the team is 3-6 and they don't have a core group of young players on the horizon.\nPlus, the NFC is the ultimate tease. The conference doesn't have the depth in talent and number of quality teams that is present in the AFC. Lack of depth can mean a fast ticket to the top or a just as fast ticket to the bottom. Jon Gruden came over from the Raiders and installed enough offense to give \n and that great Bucs defense a Super Bowl ring.\nSince then, Gruden has been trying to patch things together with free-agent veterans. Tampa Bay has been 10-15 since its Super Bowl victory and has the league's oldest team at an average age of 27.81. Old teams tend to have injuries, and the Bucs have had to place a dozen players on injured reserve already this year.\nThe Panthers went to the Super Bowl last season with the NFL's third oldest team (27.5) and entered this season as the second oldest (27.68). They have broken down with injuries and struggled to a 2-7 start.\nYouth must be served in building a team. Matt Millen had old teams in Detroit for three consecutive years. The Lions average age hovered between 27.4 and 27.5, which was crazy for a team in transition. The Lions switched their emphasis to drafting and making only one or two big signings. Now, they are a better team at 4-5 than any of the past three years, and they have gotten significantly faster and younger.\nAge can be a wonderful thing, but on NFL rosters in transition, age can't be forever.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1926667"},
{"title": "Mathis making an impact for Colts", "text": "\nQuery him about the direction in which his fledgling career might be headed and Indianapolis defensive end \n is more apt to begin a discussion (strictly a relative term for a youngster unaccustomed mini-cams and who treats every syllable as if it were gold) about where it has been.\nNot bad since, for many players, the first step toward knowing where you're going is an understanding of where the journey began.\nFor Mathis, easily the most anonymous name among the NFL's leading sackers through the first 10 weeks of the season, that was in the streets of Southeast Atlanta, where, in the playground games of his youth, he used to chase down his friends with so little effort that he often surprised himself. A dozen years later, Mathis, 23, is still surprising himself with his knack for chasing down people, in this case opposition quarterbacks.\nPerhaps more to his advantage, though, is that Mathis seems to be surprising offensive tackles, who don't know much about him until after they have been thoroughly whipped.\n\"I'm not sure I was totally prepared for his quickness,\" acknowledged \n right offensive tackle \n, after Mathis beat him for three sacks in the Colts' lopsided victory. \"He's out of the blocks like a shot, man, really explosive. But going in, no, I didn't know that much about him.\"\nA second-year veteran who recorded 3¬Ω sacks as a rookie, Mathis had better enjoy his anonymity while he can, since it won't last much longer. \n With eight sacks, he is third in the league, his name among more heralded pass rushers like \n, \n, \n and teammate \n.\nThere is no doubt that Freeney, with six sacks, is regarded as the Colts' most notable and consistent pass-rush threat, perhaps the one performer on the unit for whom opponents must prepare special blocking schemes. But with offensive coordinators dedicating their resources to stopping Freeney from bursting into the backfield, Mathis has been able to prosper while working against one-on-one blocking.\nOf course, the bashful Mathis can't figure out how that has happened, other than the fact he is doing the things that come naturally to him. Understand this: Mathis was shaped by the fact that he merged hard work and God-given quickness, two inherent gifts he feels need no hype or braggadocio on his part. In a role where most pass-rush practitioners are almost as well known for their jaw-jacking as their \"swim\" move, about the only trash-talkin' in which Mathis has taken part is when his mother, Emma Mathis, would order him to take out the garbage every week.\nNo doubt, with the help of Freeney and other teammates and by avid videotape study, he has honed his burgeoning techniques. But the former fifth-round draft pick is uncertain of how good he can be, even in another year or two, because he has very little concept of why he is so good already.\n\"Running people down, chasing after quarterbacks, it just comes natural,\" said Mathis, whose three sacks of Houston quarterback \n last week were accompanied by three forced fumbles. \"I mean, I know there's more to it than that, OK? But, to me, I'm not doing anything I haven't been doing since I started playing football. I'm just happy that it's working so well. Honestly, I never saw myself, at least year ago, doing this.\"\nA defensive end and offensive tackle at McNair High School in Atlanta, Mathis had a solid enough career. But only the elite athletes in Atlanta's inner-city schools, the players like \n tailback \n, pull in legions of college scouts on a weekly basis. Before a coach from Alabama A&M stumbled onto Mathis, he had no scholarship offers, and was writing the staff at Georgia Southern, to see if he might be a walk-on.\nIt's a fairly common tale, the lightly-recruited prep player who overcomes the lack of attention from college coaches, and then has a successful career. What is uncommon, though, is for a player with such innate pass-rush ability to be so thoroughly ignored. Defenders who can compress the pocket, speed rushers who can roar in off the \"edge,\" are about as valued a commodity as the game possesses in this era.\nYet even after he collected 44 sacks and 20 forced fumbles in 39 career starts at Alabama A&M, the NFL scouts had trouble identifying Mathis as a viable draft prospect. Scouts who visited the school mostly tabbed him as a free agent possibility, an undersized end who might, on a long shot, be able to make the transition to linebacker at the pro level. Only the Colts, who might yet try to convert Mathis to linebacker at some juncture of his young career, spoke at length with him about lining up at end.\nGiven the emphasis that head coach Tony Dungy places on raw quickness and functional speed, along with his lack of prejudice toward undersized players, Indianapolis might be the only place where the 235-pound Mathis could play end. On the second afternoon of the 2003 draft, with 137 prospects already off the board, the Colts gambled that Mathis was worth a modest fifth-round investment.\nThey certainly haven't regretted the decision.\n\"To tell the truth, I was 90 percent sure I wasn't going to be picked at all,\" Mathis said. \"Some teams had already started calling about signing me as a free agent. For whatever reason, I had about 15 or 20 family members over at my mom's house, cooking out and watching the draft, just in case. When the Colts called me, and then they said my name on TV, man, everything broke loose. Hugging, crying, screaming, you name it.\"\nAgent Hadley Engelhard, who weeks earlier had arranged a private workout for his client and convinced 18 teams to dispatch representatives, recalls that Mathis' mother nearly passed out when he explained the financial ramifications. He told her that Robert, given his draft position, would command a six-figure signing bonus (it came to $126,750) and a minimum base salary of $225,000.\n\"They had no idea, God bless them, of what Robert being draft would mean,\" Engelhard said. \"Those numbers were, well, unbelievable to them.\"\nNearly as unfathomable as the return the Colts have realized on their investment. Playing in about 20 snaps per game, a quota that allows him to maximize a high-energy approach every second he is on the field, Mathis is only two shy of matching his personal goal of 10 sacks in his second NFL season. Despite being the lone non-starter in the league's top 10, the only true situational pass rusher in the bunch, Mathis is on pace to register 14 sacks for the season.\nOf course, he is characteristically humble when asked about how high his numbers might go this season, and whether he can be a perennial double-digit sack threat. Getting to the quarterback might be old hat for Mathis but such instant celebrity is all new to him.\n\"Whatever it is that I've done to get to this point,\" Mathis said, \"I guess I'm just going to try to keep doing it.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1927550"},

It was difficult after his first loss, a defeat that wasn't settled until Manning threw incomplete to tight end \n on a fourth-and-three play with 45 seconds remaining, to discern whether the quarterback rating or the quarterback who registered it was more modest.\nThis much, however, was clear: Manning wants, and needs, more.\nMore playing time. More opportunities to throw the ball vertically instead of the ultra-conservative game plan with which he was saddled Sunday afternoon. More looks at opposition defenses in general. And plenty more support from his receivers.\nBefore the game, but without specifically mentioning the advent of the Eli Manning Era, coach Tom Coughlin told his team he needed plays from his playmakers. Especially in the first half, when Atlanta jumped to a 14-0 advantage with long scoring marches on two of its first three possessions, Manning could have sued his teammates for lack of support and made a pretty convincing case.\nOn the flip side, Falcons quarterback \n principally took matters into his own hands, and feet. Vick completed only a dozen passes, the sixth time in 10 games that he has posted 12 or fewer completions. He connected with his wide receivers just four times and concentrated mostly on getting the ball to his favorite target, Pro Bowl tight end \n, who had four catches for 47 yards and both Atlanta touchdowns.\nBut the elusive Vick also rushed for 104 yards, marking the fifth time in his career that he has gone over the century mark, a career record for an NFL quarterback. His team's top rusher for the year, Vick is now on pace to become the first quarterback in NFL history to run for 1,000 yards in a season.\nManning lacks such improvisational skills and on Sunday, the players he counted on to come up big for him too often let him down.\nBy unofficial count, Giants receivers dropped four balls, and failed to make plays on two more passes regarded as catchable. Case in point: On a first-and-10 play from the Atlanta 42-yard line late in the half, and operating from an \"empty\" alignment, Manning hung in the pocket, scanned the field, and appeared to mentally move through all his progressions before finding Shockey in the middle of the Falcons' \"Cover 2\" zone. The ball clanged off the tight end's chest and, two plays later, the Giants punted.\nIn semi-defense of the New York receivers, there were times when Manning delivered the ball a half-foot or so behind his target, or perhaps a hair too late. But any quarterback, and especially a rookie making his first start, needs his receivers to bail him out once in a while. The Giants starting wideouts, who don't have a touchdown catch now through 10 games, haven't posted bail yet this season. And, despite Shockey's dissatisfaction at not having the ball come his way enough, he still drops too many passes.\nAccording to the official play-by-play, 12 of Manning's 37 attempts were directed at Shockey and the tight end finished with five catches for 45 yards and a score.\n\"I know I have to throw the ball better,\" acknowledged Manning, who will continue as the starter when the Giants host the \n next week. \"I know that I can be more accurate. There were times I didn't set my feet, when I didn't step into my throws, or when I just didn't get the ball there in time. I got a little too anxious at times and I just hurried some stuff.\"\nUnlike predecessor \n, sacked a league-high 39 times including 24 in the last four outings before being benched by Coughlin last Monday afternoon, Manning showed some knack for escaping trouble and buying time in the pocket. He was sacked just once by an Atlanta defense that ranked No. 4 in the league in quarterback kills, drilled two nice passes while moving forward in the pocket, and showed nice touch when he got beyond the tackles with some bootleg and \"waggle\" actions.\nBut there were also two glaring mistakes in execution, an interception thrown to Falcons cornerback \n late in the first half on a deep hook, and one to defensive end \n on a play when Atlanta coordinator Ed Donatell dialed up a well-timed zone blitz. That play was a killer, coming with the Giants at the Atlanta 28, trailing by only a 14-7 count late in the third quarter.\nOn the play, Smith dropped into the left flat, and Manning allowed he never saw him. It was only the second or third time Donatell used the maneuver, and he certainly saved it for an opportune time. Donatell and several of his charges noted that the Falcons didn't change their scheme for Manning and that seemed to be the case. Hardly a blitzing team by nature, Atlanta largely held true to form.\n\"I think our attitude coming in was, 'Let's just let him play and see what happens,' and kind of adjust to that,\" Donatell said. \"If he had gotten hot, maybe we would have fired him up a little. But the action never dictated that and we pretty much played our game.\"\nAt the same time, the Giants game plan didn't mandate, either, that the Falcons resort to much of the exotic. New York attempted to control tempo with tailback \n (107 yards on 21 carries), but the Giants rarely tested the Falcons deep, and Manning's longest completion of the afternoon was for 18 yards. The Giants ran a safe collection of screens and hitches and hooks and, by unofficial count, Manning had only two attempts of more than 25 yards.\nBut even with the close-to-the-vest game plan, and the roller coaster nature of the game's pace, Manning was still in position to pen a happy ending when New York got possession at its own 26-yard line with 1:52 remaining. The Giants had only one timeout, however, and the Atlanta coverage was forcing everything between the hashes. On fourth-and-three at the Falcons' 42-yard line, Manning straightened quickly and threw low for Shockey.\nAnd this time, Brooking, again studying the rookie quarterback's eyes, read in them exactly where Manning was going with the ball, and knocked the attempt away for his second pass defensed of the contest.\n\"Hey, he's a rookie, you know?\" Brooking said. \"But he won't be a rookie for long.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1922881"},

{"title": "Mistakes cost Bengals the game", "text": "\nCINCINNATI -- Following an embarrassing 19-14 loss to the Steelers in which his team collapsed in the second half amid a flood of holding penalties and mental mistakes, Bengals coach Marvin Lewis gave his team a stern lecture. He didn't mince words.\n\"I'm angry,\" Lewis said. \"This is the angriest I've been. We cannot accept mediocrity. We are never going to go where we need to go if we accept this -- if we accept playing close, accept being in the lead in the first half and not finishing the game.\"\nThe Bengals were charitable to a fault. They had three holding penalties in the third quarter, two by wide receiver \n. Quarterback \n gave the Steelers nine points by throwing an interception that Steelers linebacker \n returned for a touchdown and taking a safety with a grounding penalty in the end zone. From personal fouls to other mental blunders, the Bengals blew a chance to beat the Steelers.\nAngry, Lewis told his team to play better or get out.\n\"There were so many points in the first half where we didn't play well enough,\" Lewis said. \"We're not going to accept that. We are going to come out this week with a better resolve than we did this last week. I told them if they're not ready to come to work, then don't come in here because we are going to be a better football team than that.\"\nToo bad the speech didn't happen during the game. The Bengals defense hustled and sacked \n seven times. The defense held the Steelers to three points on four first half trips into the red zone.\nThat obviously pleased Lewis.\n\"They played their hearts out but we have to play smart,\" Lewis said. \"I don't know how in the world we got all those penalties. It's hard to overcome those things.\"\nThe Bengals had 10 penalties for 97 yards. The second half holding penalties killed any offensive continuity.\n\"Any penalties make it tough,\" Palmer said. \"We need to do a better job in that area. It makes it tough to call plays when it's first-and-20 or second-and-20.\"\nPalmer had his own problems. He was called twice for grounding. On the interception that Farrior returned for the touchdown, there were three defenders around wide receiver \n.\n\"He said it's not acceptable,\" \n said of Lewis' post game orders. \"We are a better team that what we showed today. We're not going to accept hanging around against another team. We want to win ball games. We have six more games so everybody needs to be ready to come in tomorrow and get to work.\"\nUnfortunately, at 4-6, there is little left to gain other than pride. Playoff hopes are slowly fading. Worse, they have an angry coach. His team is mediocre and he doesn't like it.\n\"I don't want to be that way at all,\" Lewis said of mediocrity. \"Nobody is going to accept it. I don't want our fans to accept it or anyone to accept it.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1928592"},
{"title": "Martz is easy target for critics", "text": "\n,\n\nWhat is your reaction when the Coaches on the Hot Seat list comes out and Mike Martz is always near the top?  He gets vilified locally and nationally, yet his team always contends, he has productive drafts (along with Charlie Armey), his superstars take less money to stay with team and, up until last week, always deflected criticism from his players. I would assume if the Rams were ever to cut him loose, he would be offered other NFL head-coaching jobs.  Does Rams upper management hold him in the same high regard?\n\n\nJoe,\n\nYou bring up an interesting point. Even though Martz may have quieted the critics with a win over Seattle, it has definitely become vogue to rake Mad Mike over the coals every time something gets even slightly sideways in St. Louis. I think he brings some of that on himself because he fights the old-school philosophy of low-risk offense (control the ball with your running game) and sound defense. People view that as arrogance in the face of history.\n\nMartz\n\n\n\nThe Rams have proved that his formula can work just as well. It's the lack of consistency with this team that people should focus on, and maybe that falls partially on Martz's lap. What Martz has yet to prove is that he can win a Super Bowl, like his predecessor, Dick Vermeil. So the bar was set high before he ever had a chance. Anything short of a trip to the big game was going to be viewed as coming up short.\nI think Rams management knows it has a good coach and that he and VP of personnel Charlie Armey can work well together. Mike would surely be hired quickly if he's ever out of work. He's on some people's hot list because of the expectations put on the Rams.

{"title": "Patchwork Patriots triumph again", "text": "\nIf this is how the \n deal with adversity, they may never lose another game.\nThe secondary is a primary problem in New England. Cornerback \n is out, possibly until sometime late in December, with a broken bone in his foot. Cornerback \n is out another week or two with a knee injury and it was never explained how long he would be out.\nOutsiders watch the Patriots with wary eyes because they never put return times on their injured players. Bill Belichick just deals with it. So here he was in Arrowhead Stadium for Monday Night Football with a cornerback crew that should be as welcome as Kansas City tailgate barbecues. \n is a second-year corner promoted to Law's job as main coverage anchor. Other options for the Chiefs were \n, an undrafted rookie; Earthland Moreland, a practice squad recruit; and \n, a wide receiver by trade.\nSomehow, the Patriots survived this crisis with a 27-19 victory over the \n. Kansas City quarterback \n passed for 381 yards. Moreland was beaten for touchdowns of 65 and 26 yards. And if that wasn't enough, Samuel twice went down with injuries and Gay went down once.\nBelichick was starting to run out of emergency plans.\n\"We ran out of them,\" Belichick said. \"We are going to have to do a better job of that. On their last touchdown, we had a communication problem and couldn't get the right people matched up. It's tough. And it's going to be a continuing problem.\"\nBut the Patriots have survived the worst and they are 9-1. It's amazing to think they survived a four-game stretch in which they had road games against the \n, \n and Chiefs. The Steelers have a hot rookie quarterback in \n and beat the Patriots. Belichick patched the secondary and somehow pulled out wins against the Rams and Chiefs on the road, somehow allowing only 41 points.\nOutsiders call it great coaching. Those inside the Patriots organization call it headaches. Fortunately for the Patriots, their next four games are against low-ranked offenses -- Baltimore, Cleveland, Cincinnati and Miami.\nMonday night's game came down to two Chiefs possessions sandwiched around halftime. Panic set in with 2:51 remaining in the first half when Gay left with a leg injury. Two plays before his exit, Green found a soft spot in the Patriots' zone and hit \n for a 36-yard gain between Samuel and strong safety \n. Out went Gay. In came Brown, one of the team's most dependable receiver who has been helping out the secondary for weeks.\n\"It's unbelievable,\" Harrison said. \"We're just maintaining. We got a linebacker, \n, playing safety. We got a wide receiver, Troy Brown, playing nickel back. Me, I'm going down and playing the dime cornerback. We've got so many guys shuffling in and out, and it's tough. Earthland Moreland is a practice squad player and we have him starting.\"\nThe Chiefs' high-power offense moved the ball. Green, in fact, connected on his first eight passes. the Patriots may have problems in the secondary, but it helped that the Chiefs don't have a good defense. Opponents may be able to complete passes against the Patriots, but the Chiefs lose on a different fundamental. They don't tackle.\nHere's where the Patriots won. Green, trailing 17-10, had a first-and-goal at the Patriots' 9 with 1:04 left in the half. Somehow, the Patriots managed to get their patchwork secondary -- minus Gay -- to stop Green on first and second down. That left third down and the sense Green would throw to his favorite red zone target, tight end \n.\n\"They have the best tight end in the league in Tony Gonzalez,\" Harrison said. \"He killed Indianapolis in the red zone. My job was to read Trent Green, and I knew he was going to Tony. \n got a good jam on Tony. I knew I had to break on the ball.\"\nHarrison made the right break at the right time and intercepted the pass, ending the scoring threat. The Patriots maintained a 17-10 lead. Still, the Chiefs had the second half kickoff coming to them, so the defense had to prepare for another threat.\nThe drive went seemingly forever. It started at the Chiefs' 27 and went to the Patriots' 5. It lasted 8 minutes, 15 seconds -- so long that Gay was able to return. Once the Chiefs reached the red zone, the Patriots defense focused and stopped them. \n couldn't convert a third-and-1 and Dick Vermeil settled for a short field goal, leaving the Patriots with a 17-13 lead and knowing they had dodged the bullet.\nQuarterback \n and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis came to the rescue with aggressive play calls on offense. Knowing the Chiefs were going to play man coverage, Brady sent \n deep down the left sideline on cornerback \n. Patten was open, but the ball just fell out of his hands. Two plays later, Brady tried again and hit Patten for a 46-yard gain. On the next play, wide receiver \n, back after a knee injury that sidelined him eight weeks, took a short pass over the middle and weaved through the porous Chiefs defense for a 26-yard touchdown.\nThat was the game.\n\"We've scrambled around before in the secondary but never like this,\" Belichick said. \"We made enough plays, but we better defend better or eventually it's going to be a problem.\"\nBelichick grumbled seeing third-and-15s being converted like third-and-1s. He's accepted that he'll have to patch until Poole and Law return. He's revamped the defense by letting the front seven be completely responsible for stopping the run because the safeties are too busy helping out on the pass.\n\"We're maintaining, but you have to sacrifice something,\" Harrison said. \"Our goal in the red zone is holding teams to three points or forcing a turnover. We try to play some man and blitz a little to mix it up, but we play a lot of zone. When you don't have Ty Law, you don't have one of the best corners in the league and you can't get frustrated because we've got so many different guys out there. I know I find myself grabbing guys and saying, 'Get over there.' But that's what you do. You keep fighting, but it's tough, man.\"\nIt worked.\n\"You've got to give them credit,\" Green said. \"I understand better now why they are 9-1 and why have had such a long winning streak. Not having played them in a couple of years, it makes sense why they're so good. They play such a team-oriented game. This offense is solid. It doesn't make a lot of mistakes. The defense is solid. It doesn't make a lot of mistakes and special teams is solid. Across the board, they're just a solid team and they do a lot of things well.\"\nSamuel appeared to hurt his wrist on one of the final plays of the game and was screaming in pain along the sidelines. Who knows if he will be healthy enough to play against the \n on Sunday?

He's worked with the lead so much that he only trailed for 14 minutes of the previous three games.\nSunday, the clock stuck midnight and Cinderella didn't have the slipper. Pass protection broke down against a relentless Bengals pass rush. Wide receiver \n pulled a hamstring in the second quarter, robbing Roethlisberger of his best deep threat. Penalties bogged down the offense.\nRoethlisberger needed some adversity, and he responded in a big way. More than anything, he kept his composure and ran the offense even though it didn't look pretty. Afforded good field position most of the day, Roethlisberger won the game in the third quarter in what appeared to a simple drive. He avoided Bengals defensive tackle \n on a scramble to his right and lofted a 26-yard completion to tight end \n. Three plays later, before being hit, he lofted a soft touch pass to fullback \n to give the Steelers a three-point lead in what turned out to be an adventurous 19-14 victory.\n\"You all are waiting for Ben to have a (bad) game,\" Steelers coach Bill Cowher said. \"I guess this was his game. I'll say this about Ben. This was the first time I have seen him have a little bit of adversity. He handled it well. This guy never lost his composure. He was fine. He worked through it, and he never really lost any confidence. I think he grew tremendously today.\"\nThe stats were misleading. He completed 15 of 21 for 138 yards and had a 104.9 quarterback rating. Stylistically, judges would have given him a 4.2 on a scale of 10. Things that had been easy were suddenly tough. Under Roethlisberger, the Steelers were one of the leagues better red zone offensive teams. He had four trips inside the Bengals 20-yard line in the first half and didn't get a touchdown. In fact, those four red zone trips netted only three offensive points.\n\"He had situations where guys made mistakes, and that put some pressure on him,\" offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt said. \"Still, he didn't get discouraged. A couple of times, he went out of the pocket too early. If he would have taken the first read, he would have made plays. He got off the guys for whatever reason.\"\nOn the first trip to the Bengals 14 in the first quarter, a false start call against Pittsburgh was followed by a 1-yard loss by halfback \n, and then back-to-back sacks by defensive end \n, who beat right tackle \n. Instead of getting a field goal, on fourth-and-33 from the Bengals 37 the Steelers punted.\n\"I take the blame for the sacks,\" Roethlisberger said. \"On a lot of those sacks, I probably should have gotten rid of the ball. It was one of those things that you have to laugh off and come back and make something happen the next time.\"\nThe next trip into the Bengals red zone, Roethlisberger got rid of the ball too soon. Standing in the pocket on a second down, Roethlisberger thought Burress was going to run to the left corner of the end zone. Burress instead ran to the right, and the ball went to the back of the end zone for a grounding penalty. The Steelers settled for a  field goal.\nEven the third time in the red zone wasn't a charm. Roethlisberger made a nice scramble on a third down from the 20 and found \n wide open in the end zone. The play was called back because of a holding penalty and another sack again put the Steelers out of field goal range.\n\"I wasn't flustered; I was disappointed in myself,\" Roethlisberger said. \"We're a great offense. We definitely didn't play our best today, but that's the sign of a good team. You can win when you don't play good.\"\nBefore the half, Roethlisberger fumbled on a third down sack from the Bengals 18, killing another scoring threat. The Steelers went into the locker room at the half trailing, 14-10, and searching for answers.\n\n            \"I just like the fact he got off the sideline and he wanted to look at the coverages,\" Cowher said. \"He said, 'Give me the pictures, let's take a look.' We were talking about this guy being open and that guy being open. It's easy for us to say on the sidelines. He had a chance to look at it and understand it.\"\nIn the second half, Roethlisberger fought through the mistakes while his Bengals counterpart, \n, looked like the rookie. The Steelers rallied to Roethlisberger's aide. The defense punished Palmer with confusing blitzes that eventually turned Palmer into an inaccurate quarterback.  Bettis pounded out 129 yards on 29 carries to make Roethlisberger's life easier.\n\"As our leader, he's got to take the bitter with the sweet,\" said Bettis, who had his third consecutive 100-yard game. \"He did a great job of that today. He stayed poised. He stayed with a level head. If you stay with a level head, it gives you a chance.\"\nThat's where Roethlisberger showed more field savvy than Palmer. Though Palmer has two more starts than Roethlisberger, the Steelers rookie looks more like the second-year quarterback and the second-year quarterback (Palmer) looks more than the rookie.\n\"Ben definitely has a better supporting cast than Carson,\" said Steelers safety \n, Palmer's college roommate. \"He's got a great offensive line, great wide receivers and great running backs. I think it's unfair to compare them. Both are great quarterbacks. For the most part, though, Pittsburgh is a running team.\"\nThe Bengals lacked enough offensive threats that the Steelers secondary squatted on routes, not fearing they would be beaten deep. The Steelers offense controlled the clock, having 40 running plays and having the ball 38:56 minutes.\n\"It's lovely,\" Roethlisberger said. \"Having veteran guys around me, takes a lot of pressure off me. I'm out there and all I had to do is have the cadence, make handoffs and throw close to guys. My job is easy out there because of the guys around me.\"\nNext week, \n, who averaged 100 rushing yards a game before pulling a hamstring, is expected to return and take back the starting job from Bettis. Burress says his hamstring is fine, but Cowher said his tall receiver might miss a week or two. What can't be taken away is that Roethlisberger is 8-0 and he survived adversity Sunday in Cincinnati.\n\"It's a learning experience, so you learn from it and move on,\" wide receiver \n said. \"We're 9-1 and we're excited about coming home next week.\"\nAt 4-6, though, Palmer and the Bengals have no excitement.

{"title": "Falcons letting Vick use his legs", "text": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Eleven weeks into the grand experiment aimed at turning \n into a more disciplined and accurate passer from the pocket, there continues to be incremental signs of progress, but also strong suggestions that the \n staff is more intent on winning games than whittling the square peg into a round one.\nThe latest evidence came in Sunday's 14-10 victory over the \n, a contest in which the NFL's most breathtaking playmaker had more rushes (15) than completions (12). It marked the second week in a row that statistical quirk has occurred but notice, we didn't refer to it as an \n, because we aren't sure it is anymore. Clearly, coordinator Greg Knapp has added more planned runs to the repertoire and, while no one in the organization is likely to concede it, there has been a subtle change in philosophy with the slippery quarterback.\nSaid one teammate: \"It's more about letting Mike be Mike now.\"\nThat is not to suggest the Falcons have abandoned efforts to shape Vick into a more proficient passer in the West Coast derivative offense Knapp installed in the spring. Fact is, Sunday afternoon offered further validation that all parties involved in the Vick growth process probably have a better feel now for each other, an understanding of how to incorporate all the facets of his game.\nThere are times, particularly when he is throwing the ball up the seam to \n (clearly the best tight end on the field Sunday, in a game that included \n of the Giants), that Vick demonstrates poise, patience and marksmanship.\nAnd there are graphic reminders, as well, that when it comes to harnessing Vick, well, that's a work in progress. He remains inconsistent in the pocket, misses some reads, holds the ball interminably long. Know who the second-most sacked quarterback in the league is through 11 weeks? Try Vick, who has been dumped 32 times, an inordinate amount for a player with his escape dimension. The slow-footed \n, by comparison, has been sacked six times.\nBut, with Vick, the ball might never come out on rhythm as consistently as the Atlanta staff would prefer. That said, there is more room now in the Falcons offense for Vick to use his unparalleled extemporaneous gifts. With his 104 rushing yards here, Vick now has 640 yards on the ground for the season, a pace that would make him the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards. The game also marked his fifth career 100-yard effort.\nHe figures to add a few more 100-yard games to that mark before this season concludes, but also will make enough plays in the passing game, too, to keep the Falcons a viable Super Bowl contender. His average number of completions per game, a modest 12.2, isn't apt to rise dramatically. And unless Vick throws the ball better in the playoffs, and his receivers do a better job of uncovering for him, Atlanta could struggle a bit when the stakes grow higher and the opposition defenses tougher. Wideout \n, who seems neither peerless nor priceless right now, didn't have a single catch on Sunday, and that can't be all attributed to Vick.\nThe other plus for Vick, as manifested late in Sunday's game, is that he is a player valued by the league for his skills on and off the field. Game officials are charged with protecting every quarterback, no doubt, but Vick might well fall into the special category where he could be better insulated. A late-game personal foul call on New York linebacker \n, a player that, in the words of Giants coach Tom Coughlin, was \"huge, huge,\" appeared pretty dubious on replays.\nSince the Falcons aren't about to put Vick in a cocoon, neither are the game officials, but no zebra wants to be the guy who doesn't help protect one of the players who sells so many T-shirts for the NFL. Nope, Vick is plenty adept enough at putting himself in harm's way, and in escaping with Houdini-like efficiency. Sunday's win, which guaranteed only the 12th non-losing season in the franchise's 39-year history, was another indication of that.\n\nLooking North\n\nThe events of Sunday afternoon and evening suggested that the race in the NFC North might yet be one where someone actually has to \n the division, as opposed to claiming it by default. Make no mistake, the fourth-quarter comeback by the previously slumping \n was huge, given all the allusions to the team's collapse of a year ago during its three-game spiral.\nDown 19-7 to the \n entering the fourth quarter, the Vikings looked dead and uninspired. And then quarterback \n began stringing together plays, with both his arm and his feet, and Minnesota roared back to win 22-19. Suddenly, whatever collective doubt had settled in the previous three weeks on the psyche of the fragile Vikings was, at least for now, dismissed. And the Vikings get the added boost of knowing that, maybe next weekend, \n returns.\n\"I don't know what would have happened if we had lost,\" said center \n, addressing the potential unraveling that a fourth consecutive defeat might have precipitated. \"I don't want to know.\"\nNo less stirring than the Minnesota surge was the Green Bay comeback later in the evening. Playing without \n, having to rely at times on a tailback who was plucked off the practice squad earlier in the week, \n lifted the Packers from a 13-3 halftime hole in Houston.\nThe three-time most valuable player demonstrated again why he should be in no hurry to retire, throwing for 383 yards, much of that in the second half. And he did so in a week in which he suffered another off-field chink in the armor, as his mother was hospitalized during a tour to promote the book that she and her famous son co-authored. It was just another incredible chapter for a guy who plays the game with unmatched passion.\nIn one day, in victories separated by a few hours, the Vikings and Packers displayed a grit that debunked the notion neither was really worthy of a division championship. Instead, the wins suggested the NFC North race could be a fight to the (near-) finish, one possibly determined on Christmas Eve, when Green Bay visits the Metrodome in the season's penultimate contest for each club.\n\nToo late for Buffalo?\n\nAnyone notice, as the \n were slapping the \n silly on Sunday afternoon that they have now won three of their last four games, and four of their last six outings?\nOne can be forgiven for not paying enough attention to the Bills (well, actually, the Rams can't be excused for their pathetic effort along the plains of Western New York in a horrible loss), since Buffalo is still just 4-6. There has, though, been an uptick lately in the play of rookie coach Mike Mularkey's team, which is now performing the way many of us who saw Buffalo in training camp felt it might.\nCredit part of that to the play of tailback \n, who has rushed for over 100 yards in every one of the Bills' victories. Attribute some of it to the more even play of \n, who isn't turning the ball over as much, and who is making just enough plays up the field. Then again, much of the credit has to go to a defense that has been buoyed by the return of safety \n, who on Sunday had six tackles and, remarkably, three sacks.\nToo bad the Bills stumbled so much getting out of the gate this season. Too bad, too, Buffalo isn't in the NFC. At 4-6, the Bills are all but eliminated in the AFC, where there are eight clubs with winning marks. In the NFC, where only five franchises are above .500 and where it's a pretty good bet a non-winning team will snatch the final wild-card spot, the Bills would still be in the thick of the playoff race.\n\nQuarterback shuffle\n\nTwo unexpected quarterback switches on Sunday, with \n replacing \n for Arizona and Seattle going with \n when starter \n couldn't answer the bell, brought to 47 the number of different starters this season.\nThat is, given that teams have used 55-60 starters every year over the past seven seasons, not an alarming amount. But the decision by Cardinals coach Dennis Green, to bench the inconsistent McCown, means that nine of the 19 quarterback switches in 2004 have been non-injury related. That is just one shy of the number of such non-attrition switches that were made during the entire 2003 campaign, and there are more on the way.\nAt some point, it seems, Detroit will bench \n, who has thrown for just 212 yards the last two weeks (including a paltry 91 yards on Sunday), and elevate \n into the starter's role. Even if he didn't have a shoulder injury, \n might be getting the hook in Cleveland, in favor of \n. Bill Parcells might not want to turn things over to \n in Dallas for the annual Thanksgiving Day game at Texas Stadium, especially given the short week of preparation, but it's hard to fathom \n not stepping aside at some point soon. The way the 49ers are playing lately under \n, one would think \n will get some playing time, since he can't be much worse and coach Dennis Erickson has to do something to goose his lethargic offense.\nBack to Green's decision, which apparently was made during a week when King and McCown split snaps, but not announced to the quarterbacks until Saturday night after a team meeting: Hard to tell yet if it's a legitimate sign the Arizona coach has soured a bit on McCown, in whom he had demonstrated and publicly articulated so much faith, or just a one-week attempt to get a disappointing offense moving.\n\"I'm probably right a hell of a lot more than I'm wrong,\" Green said Sunday evening, speaking of his track record for such quarterback switches. Uh, maybe not this time, Denny.\nTomlinson back in the running\n\nSan Diego tailback \n, slowed for more than a month by a nagging groin injury, rushed for 164 yards on 34 carries in Sunday's victory at Oakland. That's a good sign for the Chargers who, despite getting surprisingly solid performances out of backup \n, certainly need a healthy \"LT\" for the stretch run.\nThe Chargers are for real, make no mistake about that, but things are going to get a little dicier now on the schedule for coach Marty Schottenheimer and his team. The Chargers travel to Kansas City on Sunday, then return home for an AFC West showdown with Denver on Dec. 5. Those two games should provide us an even better barometer on the Chargers, who did not play their best game on Sunday, making just enough plays to top the Raiders.\nIt was, notably, the first time the Chargers have swept the Raiders in 12 years. The Chargers, though, continue to be a model of consistency. But it sure makes them more dangerous with Tomlinson able to make his trademark hard cuts again without throttling down to change direction.\nPunts\n\nWith four tailbacks on injured reserve, the \n started little-used \n on Sunday, and he responded with a career-best 121 yards and three scores in a 35-10 trouncing of Arizona. ¬Ö Speaking of the Cardinals, one pregame show talking head assailed coach Dennis Green's first draft in Arizona. Has the guy even looked at the Cardinals' lineup? Green's top four choices -- wide receiver \n, linebacker \n, defensive tackle \n and center \n -- are all starting. ¬Ö Over the first half of the last two seasons, the New York Giants are 9-7. They are 0-10 now, however, in the second halves. ¬Ö Kudos to Tennessee veteran tailback \n, who filled in for the injured \n on Sunday and rushed for 95 yards and a touchdown. Some scouts, by the way, feel Brown might be a tad soft, which was surprising to hear, given his production in his first season as the starter. ¬Ö Despite a quarterback switch, Washington managed just six points on Sunday and now is averaging only 13.1 points per game. Anyone still think Joe Gibbs is going to be a savior this year? ¬Ö Hardly a good sign for beleaguered New Orleans coach Jim Haslett. After his team was pummeled by Denver on Sunday, owner Tom Benson suggested the Saints \"looked just like high school kids.\" Benson said it was the \"worst performance\" of his stewardship and, given the number of blowouts he has witnessed over the past two decades, that is saying something. ¬Ö After making 27 straight field goals, Cleveland kicker \n was wide right Sunday on 34- and 42-yarders. ¬Ö Unsung hero of Pittsburgh's victory at Cincinnati on Sunday: Punter \n, who had a 38.6-yard net average on seven kicks and knocked five balls inside the Bengals' 20-yard line. ¬Ö The Steelers' \n has now rushed for over 100 yards in each of the three games he has started for the injured \n. Bettis has 91 rushes for 381 yards in that stretch. ¬Ö All week long, Chicago defenders talked about how much pressure they felt they could exert on Colts quarterback Peyton Manning. Uh-huh.

There was quite a\n\nlot of diesel fuel spilled that was burning. The pickup was almost\n\nunrecognizable.\"\nStrzelczyk, who lived in McCandless, Pa., near Pittsburgh, had\n\nbeen involved in another minor accident about an hour earlier just\n\nwest of Syracuse, which started the bizarre turn of events, Simpson\n\nsaid.\nThe hit-and-run occurred about 7:20 a.m. and state police put\n\nout an alert for Strzelczyk's pickup. Troopers spotted him about 40\n\nminutes later still heading east on the Thruway.\nA second unit tried to stop the pickup by booby-trapping the\n\nroad with the \"stop sticks,\" but Strzelczyk just kept on going.\n\nThe pickup was clocked at 88 mph, Simpson said.\n\"He was going down the road, flipping off the troopers. He even\n\nthrew a beer bottle at them,\" Simpson said.\nToxicology tests by the state police crime lab in Albany could\n\ntake a few weeks to complete, Simpson said.\nA trucker saw the chase and pulled his rig across the road.\n\nInstead of stopping, the pickup drove across the grass median into\n\nthe westbound lanes and traveled about three miles in the wrong\n\ndirection before the deadly crash.\nThe collision with the tanker occurred at about 8:15 a.m. while\n\nthe highway was busy with morning commuters and travelers. The\n\ndriver of the tanker suffered only minor injuries. No one else was\n\nhurt.\nMary Joyce Strzelczyk, of West Seneca, N.Y., said she suspected her son may have been suffering from an untreated mental or emotional disorder.\n\"I'm kind of numb right now,'' she told The Buffalo News in Friday's editions. \"I had seen trouble with his mood disorders coming.\"\nShe said she last saw her son in Pittsburgh last weekend when she went to visit her grandchildren.\nThe 6-foot-3, 309-pound Strzelczyk, who grew up in a suburb of\n\nBuffalo, was an 11th-round pick in the 1990 draft out of Maine. He\n\nspent nine years with the Steelers and played in the 1995 Super\n\nBowl.\nStrzelczyk was one of the team's most durable players before a\n\nknee injury against Kansas City in October 1998 required\n\nseason-ending surgery. He reinjured the knee preparing for training\n\ncamp the next season and needed another operation that kept him on\n\ninjured reserve for the 1999 season.\nIn his first eight seasons with Steelers, Strzelczyk missed just\n\ntwo games, both in 1997. Over his nine-season career with\n\nPittsburgh, he played in 137 games and started 75.\nNine months after his release by the Steelers, Strzelczyk was\n\narraigned for illegal possession of a gun. Police said he slammed a\n\nloaded handgun onto a bar in Pittsburgh when discussing the\n\npresidential election with a friend.\nSimpson said investigators will try to retrace Strzelczyk's\n\nsteps Thursday morning leading up to the chase, to determine what\n\nmight have prompted him to flee police and crash his pickup.\n\nStrzelczyk was traveling nearly 90 mph when he collided with a\n\ntanker truck. Troopers said they did not see any brake lights on\n\nthe pickup.\n\n\t   \"We may never find out what happened or what was going through\n\nhis mind,\" Simpson said.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1892359"},

{"title": "Panthers have best DL in NFL", "text": "\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Panthers defensive tackle \n is the elder statesman of\n\nwhat may be the best front four in the NFL. He will tell you without any\n\nhesitation why the Panthers have faced so many play-action passes and\n\nthree-step drops this season.\n\"Five offensive linemen are not going to block the four of us,\" Buckner said.\n\n\"That's just not possible. I don't care who you are. Five-on-four with a\n\nstraight drop-back -- that's just not going to happen.\"\nThat's what the Panthers hope, anyway. They have invested a staggering $127.5\n\nmillion in contracts for defensive end \n, defensive end \n, defensive tackle \n\nand Buckner, all of whom are signed through at least the 2007 season. It was\n\nthat front four that helped push the Panthers to the Super Bowl last season,\n\nbut that front four also has had a mixed-bag start for Carolina so far in\n\n2004.\nTaking on Green Bay in the Monday-night opener, Carolina's defense faltered.\n\nGreen Bay's \n ran for 119 yards and scored three touchdowns to\n\nsend the Panthers to a 24-14 loss in front of a national TV audience.\n\nThe following week, however, the front four showed up again. Peppers posted a\n\npair of sacks, Jenkins wreaked havoc inside and the Panthers held the\n\nexplosive Chiefs to 10 offensive points in a 28-17 win.\nJenkins strained his shoulder in the win, and that sent chills down the\n\ncollective spine of a Panthers team that already has lost wide receiver \n for\n\nat least half the season to a broken leg and running back \n for a couple\n\nof weeks due to knee surgery. Even with the injury hampering him, Jenkins\n\nkept putting himself back into the game until defensive coordinator Mike\n\nTrgovac ordered him to take a seat on the bench.\n\"(Football) just means so much to Kris,\" said Trgovac. \"It really means so\n\nmuch to all four of those guys up front. It's a very prideful unit.\"\nPeppers ranks as the unit's most well-known player thanks to his status as\n\nthe second overall selection in the 2002 draft and his widely publicized,\n\nmultisport career in college at North Carolina. His No. 90 jersey -- along\n\nwith quarterback \n's No 17 -- dominates the stands at Bank of America\n\nStadium.\nBut for all the hype that heads Peppers' way, Carolina's defensive front four\n\nreally begins with Jenkins. The Panthers' defensive right tackle is\n\nconsidered by many to be one of the NFL's top two or three defensive tackles\n\n-- he has earned a trip to the Pro Bowl the past two seasons -- but for\n\nJenkins, there is no argument.\n\"I'll go ahead and say I'm the best,\" Jenkins said. \"But I'm not saying it in\n\na \n kind of way. I'm not over here smelling myself, you know what\n\nI mean? I'm going to keep working every day to try and be the best, because\n\njust when you get sure of yourself in this league, it all goes away.\"\nThe 6-foot-4, 335-pound Jenkins has the bulk to clog the middle in the running\n\ngame, but he also has the athleticism and the quickness to be an effective\n\npass rusher.\n\"He's a monster, basically,\" Buckner said. \"Usually a guy that big is going\n\nto be a \n type and just stop the run. But Jenkins is quick\n\nenough to get to the quarterback, too.\"\nPlaying beside Jenkins at defensive right end is Rucker, who also earned a\n\ntrip to Honolulu in 2003 after leading Carolina with 12 sacks. Rucker is a\n\nrelentless worker who prides himself on getting more sacks in the second\n\nhalf of games than in the first.\n\"Not to diminish his athleticism, but Mike doesn't have the physical gifts of\n\nJulius,\" Trgovac said. \"If you're going to block him, though, bring your\n\nlunch pail.\"\nRucker also is known as the Panthers' biggest trash talker -- he once had to\n\ncome out of a game because he hyperventilated from talking so much. He knows\n\nhow to take the art form to the extreme. But Rucker has a few trash-talking\n\nground rules that are somewhat unique in the NFL: He never curses, and he\n\nnever talks about anyone's mama.\nPeppers, the left defensive end, is the closest thing the Panthers have to an\n\nathletic freak. He is powerful, he's fast and he knows all about the\n\npressure of the big stage, having played in both the Final Four and the\n\nSuper Bowl.\n\"He can run with defensive backs and is stronger than offensive tackles,\"\n\nBuckner said.\nTrgovac makes it a point to say that opponents pay so much attention to\n\nPeppers that it gets frustrating for the 24-year-old. Peppers' sack total\n\ndropped from 12 in 12 games in 2002 to seven in 16 games in 2003.\nConsidering Peppers' suspension during his rookie year in which he sat out\n\nfour games for violating the league's banned-substance policy, there was\n\ntalk that Peppers' stellar rookie season may have been about more than just\n\nhis skills. But Trgovac dismisses that kind of nonsense.\n\"There are always going be a lot of people around him,\" Trgovac said. \"So\n\nwith Julius, we keep working on how to beat double-teams.\"\nBuckner, in his 11th season, is\n the coach\n\non the field. He's a thinker and a film watcher, always alert for tendencies\n\nhe can exploit. Buckner believes it is a blue-collar, hardworking approach\n\nthat has allowed the Panthers to turn the franchise around from a 1-15 team\n\nthree years ago to NFC champs in 2003.\nThere is depth in the line as well.\nThe Panthers feature a couple of solid reserves on the current squad. Defensive end \n, who worked as an assistant principal in 2001 when he was out of\n\nfootball entirely, posted five sacks and two interceptions in 2003 as a\n\nbackup. \n is the top defensive tackle backup, and his versatility helps\n\nkeep the Panthers fresh. The defensive line's familiarity with one another\n\nkeeps the unit stable as well.\n\"What (head coach) John Fox has done here (on defense) is just the opposite\n\nof what so many other teams do,\" Buckner said. \"So much of the offseason in\n\nthe NFL is about, 'Who's going to get \n? Who's going to get this\n\nbig-name running back?' It's teams looking for skill players, building from\n\nthe outside-in. Coach Fox is old-fashioned -- he has built us from the inside\n\nout.\"\nBuckner is right. Consider that of the starting front four, all but Buckner\n\ncame through the draft. And certainly, it's not a perfect unit.\nBuckner was suspended in 2002 for testing positive for a banned\n\nsupplement. Rucker started his career slowly, recording only one start and a\n\ntotal of 5¬Ω sacks in his first two NFL seasons. Jenkins was a rookie\n\nduring the Panthers' horrid 1-15 season of 2001 and played unevenly. He won\n\na starting job, then lost it as he slept through some meetings (in part\n\nbecause of a then-undiagnosed sleep disorder).\nBut the Panthers' current front four slowly came together. They didn't miss a\n\nbeat when then-defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio made the move to the\n\nhead-coaching job in Jacksonville, and Trgovac, the former defensive line coach, was\n\npromoted. Under Del Rio and Trogvac's guidance, they have become a whole lot\n\nbetter than the last time Carolina got excited about its D-line.\nOnly diehard Carolina fans remember the dream-turned-nightmare unit of Chuck\n\nSmith, \n, \n and \n -- all of whom were well on\n\nthe decline before they ever got to Charlotte.\nIn fact, the Panthers' current front four might be getting better. A trip to\n\nthe Super Bowl might leave some squads content with having turned things\n\naround, but for Carolina, last season's surprising run may have just been\n\nthe beginning. The players certainly believe that they have yet to play\n\ntheir best football, and it is the D-line that is expected to be the\n\ncatalyst for the ballclub.\nA trip to the Super Bowl might have been great, but a Vince Lombardi Trophy --\n\nor two or three -- might finally give the boys up front some satisfaction.\n\"We put a whole lot of pressure on our defensive line,\" Trgovac said. \"But\n\nthis group is up to it. And it better be.\"\nBest of the rest\n\n\n \nThe Panthers don't boast the only defensive line with myriad Pro Bowl\n\npersonnel. Simon and Kearse provide the Eagles\n\nwith a most impressive one-two punch. Without Kearse, the Eagles were\n\nbalancing between adequate and average. With Kearse, even elite offensive\n\nlines, like Minnesota's, can appear pedestrian for long stretches.\n\"(Jevon)\n\nis one of the better athletes I've ever seen,\" said Jim Johnson, veteran\n\ndefensive coordinator of the Eagles.\n\nJohnson bounced through the Eagles'\n\nfacility brimming with confidence on March 2, the day head coach Andy Reid\n\nbrought news of Kearse's imminent signing. If he stays healthy, Kearse can\n\nbank on playing defensive roles he's only dreamed of. In a Week 2\n\nthrashing of the Vikings' front five, Kearse played what Johnson calls a\n\n\"joker\" role, lining up as an inside linebacker, defensive end and outside\n\nlinebacker, depending on the call from the sideline. On most Sundays, he'll\n\nrush from the left side as a down lineman; he played the right side in\n\nTennessee last season.\n\"He's the kind of athlete we can move around,\"\n\nJohnson said. \"We got him comfortable with the scheme, and we're moving him\n\naround now.\"\nKearse is drawing attention beyond double-teams, opening lanes\n\nfor Burgess, Walker and Simon.\n\"Our tackles aren't\n\nthe biggest tackles in the world,\" Johnson said of Simon (6-2, 293) and\n\nWalker (6-3, 294), who thrive on uncanny lower-body bulk for power and\n\nquickness. \"Hollis is a big guy weight-wise. But we get a push. Corey and\n\nWalker are two very good pass-rushing tackles. \n and \n\nare more run-type tackles. We've always felt with Corey and Walker, we're\n\ngetting enough push in the middle. With four tackles, we rotate them on\n\nfirst and second down, and that makes a difference, too.\"\n\n\n \nThe one-man hype machine has left the building, but the Buccaneers are as\n\ndominant as ever, even without \n in the middle of the defensive\n\nline. The Buccaneers have used McFarland as a combo-tackle in their\n\nCover-2 base defense, and many scouts opined that McFarland surpassed Sapp\n\nin on-field performance last season. The line's early-season showing was\n\nimpressive, as opponents were largely held in check. McFarland posted two\n\nsacks in the first two games, and Rice is always a threat to post big sack\n\nnumbers. Rice has averaged 11.6 sacks per season since '96.\nEven without the in-house hype, the Buccaneers haven't lost their swagger.\n\"It's a completely different dynamic,\" cornerback \n said. \"It's not the\n\nsame as it once was. When Warren was Warren, and he was great, and Simeon\n\ncame in and he was spectacular, and we had Anthony playing under tackle and\n\nwhoever else -- \n and the myriad of other guys at D-end -- those\n\nwere great teams. I think the guys now know their roles are a little\n\ndifferent. It's not the same monster group of guys up there who are going to\n\ngo up and just kill everybody. Now, Chuck Darby, our nose tackle, is a\n\ngritty dude who does everything right. Anthony's trying to replace Sapp, and\n\nthe guy's legend.\"\nBarber said Spires is extremely underrated and\n\nwears the tag as the workhorse of the defense.\n\n\n \nSeattle was a sexy \"sleeper\" pick for the Super Bowl, but most\n\nprognosticators were counting on a dominant offense to carry the Seahawks\n\ninto February. But no team has allowed fewer than the 13 points surrendered\n\nby the Seattle defense through three games, and for the first time since\n\nChuck Knox's 1991 Seahawks, opponents scored seven or fewer points in\n\nconsecutive games.\nWistrom came to Seattle via unrestricted free\n\nagency. The Seahawks were interested in Jevon Kearse, but the Eagles pounced\n\ntoo quickly. In Wistrom, Seattle believes it landed a better all-around\n\ndefensive end and a superior leader.\nWhile his performance is no surprise,\n\nthe play of Moore and Woodard, both on the other side of\n\n310 pounds, has been a surprise to those outside the Seahawks' locker room.\n\nMoreover, the Seahawks couldn't be more pleased with their depth on the\n\ninterior. First-round pick \n and \n, who has three\n\nsacks through three games, will do their best to help Seahawks fans forget\n\nabout \n, \n and \n.\nHead coach Mike Holmgren\n\ncredited Randle with lighting a fire beneath Moore last season, when Randle\n\nverbally and emotionally tortured the rookie with a history of\n\nunderachieving. Okeafor is the pass rusher in the bunch. He's not\n\na monster, but his motor never stops, an advantage over plodding right\n\ntackles.\n\n\n \nGo ahead, name one of two starting defensive ends in Jacksonville? And don't\n\nsay \n, \n or even \n. You aren't in the\n\nminority if Barnes, Green, \n and \n  didn't\n\nroll off your tongue, but these were the starting candidates remaining after\n\nDouglas and Brackens were cut and Spicer suffered a broken leg in Week 2.\n\nThese players are keen to the fact that the Jaguars' defense has been\n\ndominant because of the play of Stroud and Henderson.\n\n\"Right\n\nnow, Marcus and John see things in slow motion,\" said Ray Hamilton, Jaguars\n\nDL coach. \"They get the grasp of what we're talking about, how people are\n\ntrying to attack them. The game is coming to them, and they know how to\n\nreact to it.\"\nMiddle linebacker \n is among the league leaders in tackles, and\n\nstrong safety \n isn't far behind, but Hamilton points out that both\n\nplayers owe a debt of gratitude, or at least a thank-you, to the tackle duo that\n\nhas been a springboard for their success.\n\"Any linebacker would love to play\n\nbehind John and Marcus,\" Hamilton said. \"They knock the guards back, keep\n\nthe guards and the centers off the linebackers. Mike Peterson is having a\n\ngreat season, and one part of it is that John and Marcus do a great job of\n\nkeeping him clean.\"\nStroud moves like a 275-pounder, a stunning aberration\n\nto offensive guards accustomed to squaring off against slow-footed\n\n330-pounders. He's constantly double-teamed, but his tedious preparation and\n\nfootball intelligence keep Stroud ahead of the game. Stroud and an upstart\n\nlinebacker corps are the main reasons the Jaguars hadn't allowed a 100-yard rusher\n\nin 17 games before Titans running back \n snapped the streak by rushing for\n\n101 yards in Week 3.\nHenderson is underrated -- at 6-7, 317, you'd think\n\nhe'd be hard to miss.\n\"John is a big, powerful guy,\" Hamilton said. \"When he\n\nhunkers down in there, even when he sees two or three guys on him, they just\n\ncan't move him. John gets around pretty well, too. He's not known as a speed\n\nguy, but he's quick. Marcus plays fast; John plays with strength, just kind\n\nof kills people at the point of attack.\"\nHonorable mention\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1891098"},

He came in the series after Testaverde got hit and had\n\nanother player land on him after throwing his second interception.\nHenson's first play resulted in a fumble when a blown blocking\n\nassignment let a defender through untouched. But he came back and\n\ncompleted all six of his passes, including a 1-yard TD toss in the\n\nCowboys' 30-10 loss.\n\"It was nice to get in and start answering some of these\n\nquestions that I have and the coaches have, and everyone else,\"\n\nHenson said. \"It was just a taste of it. At least I know I've been\n\nout there, and the newness and having to be the first time, that\n\nstuff's behind me.\"\nUntil forced Sunday, Parcells had been reluctant to use Henson.\nParcells wanted to give Henson, who spent three years after\n\ncollege playing pro baseball, the best opportunity to succeed. He\n\nalso was concerned about sending the message to his team that he\n\nwas giving up on this season.\nNow the 41-year-old Testaverde is ailing with a short break\n\nbefore the next game. Plus, the Cowboys have lost six of seven\n\ngames, four of them by 20 points or more.\nBut Parcells still believes that Testaverde, if healthy, could\n\nbe the best option.\n\"Probably a little bit better chance to get out of this hole\n\nthat we're in right now, in terms of winning games,\" Parcells\n\nsaid. \"It's hard enough to win them with experienced players where\n\nwe are right now. But to win with inexperienced players is\n\ncertainly more difficult.\"\nThen again, the only way for Henson to get experience is to\n\nplay.\nHenson's only action until Sunday had been as a holder on kicks,\n\na duty he would likely keep even if he is the starting quarterback.\nParcells called a bootleg on Henson's first play. The coach\n\nfigured Baltimore would expect him just to hand off to a running\n\nback.\n\"It was a good idea because it would get him on the perimeter,\n\nbut we just completely missed an assignment on the play side and he\n\ndidn't have a chance,\" Parcells said.\n was quickly in Henson's face after guard Andre\n\nGurode missed the block. Henson lost his grip on the ball when he\n\nwas being tackled and the Ravens recovered at the 1.\n\"That type of thing happens so fast,\" Henson said. \"Yeah, you\n\nwould like a little bit different first snap, but it happened and I\n\ntried to move on.\"\nAfter Baltimore scored their last touchdown, Henson led the\n\nCowboys on a 16-play, 80-yard drive on which he completed his six\n\npasses.

{"title": "Chiefs suddenly struggling in red zone", "text": "\nTo the expanding litany of woes that has plagued the winless \n through the first three weeks of the 2004 campaign, a spate of unexpected problems that extends far beyond the usual defensive shortcomings versus the run, one more has now been added.\nTypically among the NFL's most productive \"red-zone\" offenses, in large part because of tailback \n, the Chiefs went from efficient to deficient in last Sunday's defeat to a \n team which characteristically struggles when backed up inside its own 20-yard line.\n\"We weren't as precise (in the red zone) as we have been,\" acknowledged Holmes, who was stuffed for a one-yard gain on a fourth-and-two from the Houston six-yard line in the second quarter. \"One of our trademarks when we're down in close is that we always find a way to get the ball in the end zone.\"\nWell, not \n anymore, apparently.\nThe failure to create a crease for Holmes on the fourth-and-two play on Sunday paled in comparison to the Chiefs' other red-zone gaffe. That would be a much-replayed pratfall in which Texans free safety \n stepped neatly in front of a \n aerial intended for tight end \n in the end zone, and then sprinted 102 yards up the left sideline with the interception return.\nOf such failures -- a touchdown there would have staked Kansas City to a 21-7 lead but instead knotted the game at 14-14 -- are ugly 0-3 starts hatched.\nThrough three games of the 2003 season, the Chiefs had cashiered touchdowns on all seven trips to the red zone, and Kansas City concluded the year as the league's premier red-zone offense. This year, the Chiefs have ventured inside the opponents' 20-yard line nine times, and have six touchdowns and a field goal.\nKansas City's 66.7 percent touchdown rate in the red zone for 2004 isn't embarrassing but, as with most things Chiefs-related to this point, it is significantly less than we have come to expect from a Dick Vermeil team. Vermeil is marvelous in preparing a team, a stickler for detail, and efficient red-zone offense has been one of his teams' trademarks.\nThen again, the Chiefs are hardly the lone offense for whom the red zone has become a dead zone so far in 2004.\nScoring from in-close has become, at least through the first three weeks of the campaign, much more difficult. To this juncture, this has been a season in which a constricted field seems to have tightened the gullets of head coaches and offensive coordinators. It is a red zone year marked by reduced scoring, a dearth of imagination, and costly turnovers. And in many cases, particularly in some high-profile early-season matchups, inconsistency in the red zone has defined the outcome of games.\n\"Definitely, it's kind of a deflating thing to not score touchdowns in the red zone,\" agreed Indianapolis' emerging young wide receiver \n. \"I know, in our case, we feel like we can score from anywhere, but especially down (close), because we have so many weapons that \n) can go to near the goal line. Let's be honest, you turn the ball over in the red zone, or don't get into the end zone, yeah, it's magnified.\"\nIndeed, the first three games have represented a red zone mixed bag for the Colts, who lead the NFL with 69 red-zone points but have squandered some notable opportunities. Indianapolis has nine touchdowns and a pair of field goals on 14 red-zone forays. But the Colts would be 3-0, and have finally excised the New England monkey from their backs, had they been more proficient in the red zone in the season opener against the Patriots.\nThree times in that reprise of the 2003 conference championship game -- on an interception tossed by Manning from the New England six-yard line and two \n second-half fumbles -- Indianapolis coughed the ball up in the red zone. They also settled for a field goal, on another occasion, after driving to the New England 14-yard line.\nLikewise, the \n, second in the league with 58 red-zone points, certainly have experienced mixed results inside the 20. The Vikings have 15 red-zone possessions, but have scored on just two-thirds of them, with seven touchdowns and three field goals. Wide receiver \n has been brilliant in the red zone this year, with all five of his touchdown receptions coming from four yards or less, and an average of 2.6 yards.\nBut those have been somewhat overshadowed by red-zone meltdowns, like the fumble at the goal line by quarterback \n in the Monday night loss at Philadelphia, or settling for a field goal from the Eagles' one-yard line in that defeat.\n\"Those kinds of (failures),\" acknowledged Vikings center \n, \"will make you crazy. You play with such a small margin for error in this league to begin with, you know, and when you lose scoring chances like that, boy, it hurts.\"\nFor sure, then, red-zone numbers from the first three weeks must be particularly painful for offenses around the league.\nTo date, teams have an aggregate 50.1 percent touchdown rate in the red zone, scoring on 137 of 273 opportunities. There have been 83 field goals and 1,205 points. Compared to the first three weeks of the 2003 season, however, those numbers are puny. At this point a year ago, offenses had scored touchdowns on 55.1 percent of the red-zone opportunities, and scored either a touchdown or field goal 91.3 percent of the time (compared to just 80.6 percent this year).\nPoints per red-zone possession this year, 4.41, are down 5.2 percent from the 2003 level after three weeks. Turnovers in the red zone have increased by a similar percentage.\nThe reason the red zone has become such a riddle this year? Well, in any given season, there are going to be offensive mistakes in the scoring zone: bad decisions, fumbles and interceptions, missed blocks and squandered opportunities born of ineptitude. But while blaming offenses, it might be time to credit defenses, too, for ramped-up aggression.\nOne quarterbacks coach from an NFC team insisted that he has seen more blitzing from defenses in the red zone this year than in most recent seasons. Defenses typically blitz more in red-zone situations anyway, because there is less real estate for exposed corners and safeties to cover. \"But we're seeing more all-out (blitzes) in the red zone, people taking more chances, trying to force the error,\" said the quarterbacks coach.\nMore offenses continue to use three-wide receiver sets in the red zone, too, as opposed to formations featuring multiple tight ends. At a time when tight ends have re-emerged as a presence in the middle of the field, their role, ironically, has diminished in the red zone. One more factor: The bigger cornerbacks that have become so popular over the last few seasons are more adept at taking away lob and fade routes. Moss may be an impossible matchup, no matter the cornerback, but there aren't many Moss-type receivers around.\nThe upshot of it all is that, through three weeks, some offenses have been left red-faced by their red-zone struggles.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&page=/trend/2004week3"},

{"title": "Lewis trial scheduled to begin Nov. 1", "text": "\nATLANTA -- Discussions are ongoing about a plea agreement that would allow \n running back \n to avoid a trial on drug conspiracy charges and serve only a modest prison term, federal authorities confirmed Friday.\nThe story was initially reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in its Friday editions, with the newspaper citing lawyers familiar with the Lewis case.\nSources from two federal agencies involved in the case told ESPN.com that negotiations between federal prosecutors and attorneys Ed Garland and Don Samuel, who represent Lewis, have been going on for a few weeks. But one federal law enforcement agent added that a resolution, which would have to be approved by U.S. district judge Orinda Evans, is not imminent.\n\"He might have crossed the 50[-yard line],\" said one source, referring to Lewis, \"but he [isn't] near the end zone yet, I don't think.\"\nA key element to the plea negotiations, sources said, is not only how much time Lewis might spend in prison but when it would be served. Obviously, Lewis would prefer to serve any prison time during the offseason.\nLewis, an Atlanta native who played at Douglass High School, is charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine and using a cell phone to plan a drug transaction. The charges are the result of an FBI investigation in the summer of 2000. If convicted, Lewis could face a sentence of at least 10 years, however, under the plea agreement he might serve less than a year.\nAccording to one source, as part of any deal Lewis would \"almost beyond doubt\" have to provide the prosecution with testimony against his friend Angelo Jackson, who is facing similar charges. Tomeka Richard, working with the FBI posing as a drug dealer, allegedly contacted the Ravens tailback in June of 2000. Prosecutors say Lewis introduced Richard to Jackson, who allegedly met later that summer with Richard to plan a drug deal.\nRichard is a key witness; if the case proceeds to trial it is generally agreed the defense will vigorously try to impeach her credibility. Even while cooperating with the FBI, court and arrest records indicate, Richard continued to commit other crimes, most of them related to fraud.\nFederal prosecutors are prepared to go to trial on Nov. 1 if an agreement cannot be reached. Lewis' attorneys did not immediately return phone messages.\nEven if Lewis pleads to a reduced charge, he still could face sanctions from the NFL, sources agreed. Under terms of the NFL's personal conduct policy, a player is subject to review even if he enters \"a plea to a lesser ... offense.\" Punitive action from the NFL  would be at the discretion of the commissioner and can range from a fine, to suspension, to banishment from the league.\nLewis, 25, was a first-round choice of the Ravens in the 2000 draft. The offenses he is charged with allegedly occurred after the draft but before Lewis, who played collegiately at Tennessee, signed his first NFL contract.\nExcept for 2001, when he missed the entire NFL season because of a knee injury suffered in training camp, Lewis has led the Ravens in rushing every year he's been in the league. In '03, he became only the fifth player in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in a season.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1893018"},

Davis' job status was the subject of discussion Sunday night by Browns owner Randy Lerner after the team lost 10-7 to the New York Jets earlier in the day, the sources said. It was the fourth straight defeat for Cleveland (3-7).\nLerner contemplated dismissing Davis on Monday but decided to give the Browns another week to show signs of life. The Browns play the Bengals in Cincinnati on Sunday, and the sources agreed that a defeat likely would result in the coach's dismissal. It is believed Browns defensive coordinator Dave Campo would be the interim coach, although offensive coordinator Terry Robiskie has served previously as an interim head coach with the Washington Redskins.\nNeither Lerner or Davis was available for comment Monday night.\nLerner has been committed to restructuring the football operations of the organization, which would include the hiring of a general manager. Davis currently has the authority for all football decisions.\nDavis, 52, is in his fourth season as the Browns coach. He inherited an expansion team that was 5-27 under its first coach, Chris Palmer. Davis' career record is 23-35, including a playoff season in 2002. However, the Browns have been a franchise marked by numerous injuries to players, poor drafts and player development, significant   turnover in the front office and the death of owner Al Lerner.\nLerner's son, Randy, actually signed Davis to a two-year contract extension before the 2004 season got underway, through the 2007 season.\n\"Randy Lerner is pretty determined to start over and get this thing fixed,\" a league source said.\nIf Davis is fired soon, it wouldn't surprise some of his friends if he pursued the vacant University of Florida job.

{"title": "Despite hurdles, QB still believes", "text": "\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Fate brought \n and \n together, horses helped them forge a friendship. They were teammates in New Orleans for one season, 2002; Delhomme's last with the Saints, Cox's last in the NFL. They like to discuss the sport of kings and spent many a Monday afternoon together at the Fair Grounds.\nRecently, with the \n season coming apart and Delhomme clearly, at least from Cox's vantage point, trying to salvage it alone, the quarterback and the outspoken sports talk show co-host had a football conversation. Actually, it was more Cox talking and Delhomme listening.\n\"He was like, 'Hey, you keep fighting,' \" Delhomme said Monday, a day after the Panthers earned their first victory this season at Bank of America Stadium, 35-10 over the Cardinals. \"He said, 'It's hard, but this will make you better in the long run. I've been watching you play. You've just got to get it out your hand, set your damn feet. You can tell you're trying to do too much. I'm calling because I care about you and I love you.' \"\nAnother ex-teammate with the Saints, former quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver, left an encouraging voice message offering similar counsel, telling Delhomme to simply progress through his reads. Delhomme also solicited wisdom from his understudy, \n, who is nine years his elder, and Peete, likewise, told him not to try to take the offense upon himself, but to instead just take what the defense gives him.\nDelhomme has taken his friends' advice and his game up a notch, tossing eight touchdowns and one interception this month for revitalized Carolina (3-7), whose consecutive victories and remaining schedule have the folks there talking about the possibility of the Panthers in the playoffs.\nDon't dismiss it. The Panthers play New Orleans and Tampa Bay twice, St. Louis at home, and Atlanta on the road, and the way they've looked in the last game and a half, and the way the NFC looks this year, hey ¬Ö\n\"Every game we've had a chance,\" Delhomme said. \"We've killed ourselves. And I truly believe other teams realize it. They're saying, 'Look at the injuries, look what's happened, and these guys are with us?' \"\nWhat is it lately with quarterbacks coming off a Super Bowl defeat? If the fortunes of the last three may be likened to an amusement park ride, it would be the Tower of Terror -- for each, they fell hard and fast. \n started to lose it in 2002 and ultimately lost his starting job in St. Louis. Most of \n's 2003 season was lost to injury. Delhomme, in a different sense, has battled injuries in The Year After -- an inordinant amount to his supporting cast, the primary cause for Carolina's 1-7 start, the worst ever by a Super Bowl participant from the previous year.\nSuper Bowl stars \n, \n, and \n are among the Panthers' league-high 13 players on injured reserve. They're down to using fullbacks as halfbacks. The backfield situation has been so dire that Foster, though he hasn't played since the fourth game, still leads the team in rushing with 255 yards. Delhomme looked around his huddle Sunday and noticed one guy, \n, whom he met last Wednesday morning, and another, \n, who, by comparison, Delhomme goes way back. Like, a whole month.\n\"We expected big, big things out of this year,\" said Delhomme, who is bothered by a bad right (throwing) thumb. \"Big things. So many people would bring up, 'Look at the teams that lost the Super Bowl. They can't make it back to the playoffs.' That never really entered my mind because there was no doubt that that was never going to happen. But what has happened to us injury-wise, I don't think anybody could have every imagined.\n\"It's to the point where it's not comical, but this is the hand that's been dealt.\"\nDelhomme and the Panthers aren't ready to fold just yet. The O-line and secondary are starting to gel. The running game, with \n going for 121 and three scores, stepped up against Arizona. Delhomme and \n have got something going, with five touchdown connections in two games and seven in four. Delhomme has come to trust the players around him, even if he barely knows some of them. He's a gambler by nature, and with little to lose, the Panthers can take even more chances, like going for a touchdown at the end of the half against Arizona rather than playing for a field goal.\n\"At one point this year, I tried to do too much,\" Delhomme said. \"No doubt about it. I felt, 'We have all these guys down, somebody's gotta do something.' I might have been pressing. I was missing throws here and there trying to make the perfect throw instead of playing.\"\nLast year practically was perfect for the Panthers. Now they're dealing with the evening-out process. Last year the Cardiac Cats won every close game but the last one. They didn't have major injuries. It's been the opposite in '04.\n\"Everything went too smooth last year,\" Delhomme said. \"Last year, my back was sore from getting patted on the back too much.\n\"This has made me so much of a better player. I've had to grow up.\"\nIt is said that adversity doesn't develop character, it reveals it. No one tried abandoning ship when it appeared to be sinking.\n\"The thing that I'm most encouraged about is nobody's ever pointed a finger in this locker room. Not even close,\" Delhomme said. \"There was no bitching or complaining. So what if we had injuries? Nobody's coming to save us. We've got to get this thing turned around. We could have easily gone in the tank and said screw this season. When I tell you it hasn't been like that, it hasn't been at all.\n\"It's the hand we're dealt.

Detroit hasn't won since defeating the \n on the road Oct. 24, a victory that raised the Lions' record to 4-2, and Harrington has been sporadic during the ensuing losing streak.\nMost people suffer a Thanksgiving hangover. Harrington is hopeful that the game will snap the Lions offense from its tryptophan\n-like malaise of the past month.\n\"I think maybe the one thing that may be good is playing on Thanksgiving,\" Harrington said, after it was determined Monday that he will keep his job for at least one more game. \"It has a way of bringing out the best in this team. It has in the past, at least. ... There is something about this town on Thanksgiving. The whole country is watching, and that gives you a little extra motivation.\"\nThen again, motivation should not be that difficult a commodity to locate for Harrington, who has started the last 26 games but is now looking over his shoulder.\nBackup \n, the starter when Harrington arrived as a first-round choice in the 2002 draft, logged increased practice time last week. Even with the short preparation time for the Thanksgiving game, McMahon will get additional work with the No. 1 offense this week, although coach Steve Mariucci has acknowledged he isn't inclined to make a change during a game unless the contest is out of reach.\nSaid Mariucci, who has adopted a big-picture approach to the offense but allowed that the quarterback position must be examined: \"It's a matter of seeing how we are as a team, seeing how we're playing, the score of the game, the efficiency of the position. If we feel a spark is needed, or something, we'll consider it.\"\nAnother spotty performance by Harrington, though, and McMahon could move into the starting job by the Dec. 5 game against Arizona. After the Thanksgiving matchup, Mariucci and his staff will have ample time (10 days between games) to evaluate Harrington and the overall quarterback situation.\nThere have been 19 quarterback switches through the first 11 weeks of the season, and nine of them were non-injury-related changes.\nAlthough the Lions' current offensive slump is not solely attributable to Harrington, the dismal output in the four-game losing streak reflects his subpar performances. During the losing streak, Harrington completed 68 of 136 passes for 736 yards, with four touchdown passes and four interceptions.\nThose numbers include an 11-for-33 outing against Washington two weeks ago. In the past two games, Harrington has thrown for just 212 yards, including only 91 yards in last Sunday's loss to the \n, a game in which Detroit led by 12 points going into the fourth quarter.\nMariucci conceded that Harrington has not made enough plays in the past three games, a stretch in which the Lions' offense has registered just two touchdowns, and the Detroit quarterback has acknowledged that, as well.\nIn the 28-13 victory at Giants Stadium, Harrington was superb, completing 18 of 22 passes for 230 yards, with two touchdown passes and no interceptions. In truth, he missed on just one pass in that game, since he had two \"throwaways\" and another ball dropped on him. Harrington played within himself that day, using the weapons around him and demonstrating great patience.\nBut whatever progress Harrington displayed versus the Giants has been overshadowed by the last four outings.\nThis is viewed as a critical season for Harrington and the Lions. The team has attempted to surround Harrington -- a talented quarterback, but not generally viewed around the NFL as an elite player, one who can win games on his own -- with upgraded weaponry in the past two years. While the Lions have more playmakers now, that hasn't translated into more consistency at the quarterback position.\nA former Oregon star, Harrington was the third player chosen overall in 2002, amid some disagreement in the Detroit front office. He assumed the starting job in the third game of his rookie season and has held it, except for injuries, ever since.\nThe pressure on him aside, and despite the rumors he is under heavy scrutiny, Harrington insisted he does not feel as though he is playing for his job.\n\"I'm not playing like I'm playing for the job,\" he said. \"I'm playing for this team. I'm playing to continue to be the quarterback on this team. We need to improve as a team and as an offensive group, and I'm going to continue to play that game.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1929949"},

But I was glad to see him get some work and glad our fans got an opportunity to see Drew make some decisions.\"\nNow Henson, acquired this offseason in a trade with the Texans, looks like \n Thursday against the Bears.\nWith Testaverde hampered by his shoulder and a sore back, Parcells said Tuesday there was \"a good chance\" Henson would start and that he would take most of the snaps in practice Tuesday.\nWhile Henson is still waiting like everyone else to get the official word on his status this week, he's at least glad to now have some game experience.\n\"It's good to get it out of the way,\" Henson said. \"That is one question we don't have to answer.

Coleman, who had five tackles, sacked \n for a three-yard loss on third-and-six with around four minutes left. The Browns were forced to punt and never got the ball back.\nJones, sidelined for seven games with a broken collarbone, got his most extensive work of the season in Sunday's loss to Baltimore. The second-rounder from Notre Dame had 30 carries for 81 yards and already has been named the starting tailback against the Bears on Thursday. \"I thought he did a good job fighting and competing,\" coach Bill Parcells said of Jones. \"I never got a sense he wanted out of the game. I really was pleased with him about that.\"\nThe fifth-rounder from Ohio State struggled again in what was the Bears' worst loss of the season. Krenzel completed 14 of 24 passes for 175 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions during a 41-10 defeat to Indianapolis. For the season, Krenzel is 54-for-117 passing for 672 yards with three touchdowns and six interceptions.\nManning didn't take a pounding like \n, but the first overall pick suffered through some of the same problems as his predecessor. Manning completed 17 passes, but had several other passes dropped as the Giants fell to Atlanta for their third-straight defeat. \"He played well enough for us to win,\" tight end \n said. \"The skill positions, myself, we just didn't make plays for him.

He \n started the first three games of the season but was able to finish only one.\nJourneyman offensive lineman \n, who replaced Flanagan in the two games the ninth-year veteran could not complete, now moves into the starting lineup. Ruegamer, a solid player who had only three career starts in four previous seasons, is well-schooled in Green Bay's offense. He recently agreed to a pay cut to help the team's salary cap situation.\n\"Mike has experienced tremendous pain with this, has played with it, and it's just been debilitating,\" said coach Mike Sherman of the tendinitis in Flanagan's left patellar tendon. \"He's going to have to have surgery in the next 10 days and it will probably take about six months for recovery.\"\nEarlier this season, Flanagan, 30, was described by one Green Bay coach as the \"most valuable lineman\" on the Packers' roster. An extremely versatile player, he has moved out to play tackle in the past, when injuries precipitated a lineup shuffle, and is one of the game's best technicians.\nThe former UCLA star joined the Packers as a third-round pick in 1996. He struggled with injuries earlier in his career, appearing in only two games in his first three seasons before settling into the starting lineup in 2001.\nFlanagan is so key to the Packers, whose line unit has been together for four seasons, that Sherman often limited Flanagan's practices between games, so he would be available on Sunday afternoons.\nGreen Bay will place Flanagan, who has appeared in 84 games with 54 starts, on injured reserve. His roster spot probably will be filled by Scott Wells, a rookie offensive lineman and seventh-round draft pick who has been on the Packers' practice squad.\nFlanagan first experienced pain in his left knee last season but attributed it to the normal wear and tear associated with offensive line play. Doctors then diagnosed the tendinitis condition during the spring.\nHe had hoped to avoid surgery, which he knew was inevitable, until after this season, but the pain became insurmountable in recent days.\n\"There's nothing left to do,\" Flanagan told the Green Bay media of his condition. \"We've exhausted all (other) attempts.

{"title": "Come to Jesus", "text": "\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- \n grabbed the game ball and silenced his teammates, inspiring 52 sets of eyes to burn into the most powerful personas and presences in the Giants' locker room: the franchise star and the coach, Tom Coughlin. After the first victory of the season, they stood shoulder to shoulder, an uneasy partnership solidified with sport's most traditional tonic. Winning.\n\"For his first win as head coach of the \n,\" Strahan said, lifting the ball into the air and then handing it to Coughlin. \"Hopefully there are many more to come.\"\nWhen the Giants had appeared to be on the brink of a revolt, the strangest thing happened: They're on the cusp of a revolution. Coughlin has started to reshape the way his players view him, his values and his rigid ways. And all that begins and ends with Strahan, because everything does on these Giants.\nAfter witnessing the moment the Strahan-Coughlin thaw started after the Redskins game two weeks ago, receiver \n said, \"Everybody knows how they haven't been seeing eye-to-eye. But the main thing that they have in common is that they both want to win. This showed that winning takes care of everything.\"\nSometimes, it can be this simple. Strahan called the powers of victory \"healing,\" and understood that the chances of Coughlin and him coming closer together had a lot to do with winning games. Now, New York has won two straight games on the way to Green Bay on Sunday, where they'll have a chance to declare themselves as legitimate playoff contenders. For the Giants, Green Bay and Dallas are back-to-back road acid tests to determine the legitimacy of the season.\nNevertheless, these games should no longer have to bear the burden of defining the bond between the coach and best player. They've come a long way in a brief time, pushed past the furor over offseason workout programs and meeting fines to reach common ground.\n\"He has everybody's respect as a coach,\" Strahan says. \"If we listen to him, if we follow his plan, we're going to be successful.\"\nFor two weeks, the fine leveled on Strahan and two teammates for failing to show up only two minutes \n for a team meeting had transformed into a locker room obsession and the spark of a national debate. For all the insistence that Coughlin would never ease back, he did reach out. In the wake of that past week, he was touched by Strahan's gesture with the game ball. It did go a long way toward soothing hard feelings, and maybe, a longer way toward inspiring Coughlin to reach back out to Strahan.\nAfter the team meetings on the eve of last Sunday's victory over Cleveland, Strahan was grateful with the way Coughlin asked about the player's pregnant wife and the impending birth of twin daughters, even sharing stories about his own granddaughter. Suddenly, Coughlin didn't seem so eager to embrace his reputation as an ogre, and behind the scenes, the Giants started to see a softer side of him. He started to show them there was a human being there, someone they hadn't been sure existed beyond the sullen eyes and grim face.\n\"He's definitely gone out of his way to make more of a connect with his players,\" Strahan said. \"The players appreciate that, and I think that's the reason we're playing as hard as we are for him.\"\nStrahan was downright dominant in the 27-10 victory over the Browns, delivering two sacks and recovering two fumbles. All along, there was an unmistakable truth destined to be discovered: Strahan is everything Coughlin wants out of a football player. He practices hard, plays hurt and performs on game days.\nIn sports, there's nothing as important for a coach than getting his star players on his side. Because if they're not working for the coach in the locker room, they're working against him. Coughlin's best players with Jacksonville still swear by him, with \n and \n, two of his ex-Pro Bowl Jags, insisting they would play for him again. \"If he can get his core guys to believe, when they bring in other guys around them, the core guys are going to police the whole thing for him,\" says Walker, the \n defensive tackle. \"But he'll keep cutting down that core, until he gets his guys in there.\"\nEven the players most dissatisfied with Coughlin grudgingly admit he has them incredibly prepared to play every week and that goes a long way with athletes. If a coach is going to be a brutal taskmaster, his hard line has to be backed with the belief he's completely competent. No one disputes his acumen in the Giants' locker room, even if they had found fault with his methods.\n\"Once you start to respect those rules, understand why they're there, he starts to grow on you,\" McCardell says. \"You start to do things like him, you start to become like him. But it's all a lot easier to see if you start winning.\"\nThree weeks ago, no one would've believed it --- maybe not even Strahan himself. All he knows now is that the Giants have a winning record, and they're turning into a leaner, tougher and sharper team under his iron fist. Suddenly, the franchise player is a Coughlin convert too.\nAnd perhaps it began innocently enough, with Strahan handing the game ball to his coach. To many more victories, he toasted. Many more. Ultimately, Michael Strahan gave his teammates a cue this football season, and finally, they cheered Tom Coughlin in his locker room.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=wojnarowski_adrian&id=1892988"},
{"title": "No surgery, but no expedited return", "text": "\n will not require surgery on his left foot, but the \n' starting free safety, injured in last week's loss to the \n, still probably will miss at least eight more weeks.\nThat was the verdict delivered to Schulters by noted foot expert Dr. Robert Anderson of Charlotte, N.C., certainly a mixed-bag prognosis for the struggling Titans and for their standout safety. Anderson confirmed the earlier assessment by Tennessee doctors that Schulters has a mid-foot sprain, commonly known as a Lisfranc injury.\nSuch foot injuries, which have increased significantly in the past three seasons, typically require season-ending surgery. Instead, Schulters must keep his foot immobilized in a protective boot for at least four more weeks. Even if there is progress in healing at that point, Schulters still would not play for about another month after that.\nThe seventh-year veteran, a key to the Titans' secondary because he makes many of the adjustment calls for the unit and is a physical performer, will seek a third opinion in New York next week. But team officials acknowledged the prognosis for Schulters is not likely to change.\n\"Relatively speaking,\" said coach Jeff Fisher, \"at least there is still a chance we could get him back for the stretch run. And, I guess, that beats surgery. It's a relief of sorts.\"\nThird-year veteran \n, who has seen considerable playing time when the Titans employ a nickel coverage package, will replace Schulters, and will get the first start of his career Sunday against the \n. In the team's season-opening victory, Thompson had a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown.\nBlessed with prototype size, Thompson, 26, is an intriguing player. A star at Washington State, he was chosen by the \n in the second round of the 2002 draft. But after a pedestrian rookie season, Thompson was released by the Bengals when Marvin Lewis became head coach in 2003.\nThe Titans quickly snatched up Thompson, whom they viewed as an eventual starter, and he has played well in spot duty for them. Along with strong safety \n, he will give the Titans a physically imposing safety tandem.\n\"The biggest difference for me is in the mental stuff,\" Thompson said. \"I'm going to have to take some mental responsibilities [Schulters] always handled, that's the real test.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1893481"},
{"title": "Money matters make it tough to change right now", "text": "\n\nAmid reports he could soon be fired, \n coach Butch Davis will retain his job through the rest of this season, several sources told ESPN.com.\nThose sources, some of them in the league and other close to Davis, said that Cleveland officials determined Tuesday that they will wait until after the season to review the status of the Browns' head coach. There had been strong hints that Davis could leave the franchise as early as Tuesday, only under certain conditions that did not include his dismissal, but the events moved in another direction.\nThe feeling was that, with such open speculation about his future, Davis would press owner Randy Lerner for a resolution of his status beyond this season. The rationale was that, if Lerner confirmed Davis would not be back in 2005, Davis might resign. But had that occurred, Davis would have turned his back on the three seasons remaining on his current contract.\nLast summer, Lerner extended Davis' contract two seasons, through 2007, and it is believed he is owed between $10 million and $12 million on that deal. In fact, sources said the only way Davis will leave the Browns before the year ends is if he sacrifices the money remaining on his contract or if Lerner has a philosophical change of heart about firing a coach during the season.\n\nOn Sunday night, Lerner did consider firing Davis, as first reported by ESPN's Chris Mortensen.\n\nIn response to the speculation about Davis' future, the team\n\nissued a statement saying it wasn't planning any changes.\n\"The Cleveland Browns organization is acutely aware of our\n\nfans' passion and share in their desire for a championship team. We\n\nacknowledge the disappointment and frustration with this season's\n\nrecord,\" it said. \"In response to a variety of media reports, we\n\nreiterate that we are keeping our organization intact in order to\n\nfocus our efforts toward winning our remaining football games. Our\n\ncommitment to Cleveland, and to winning, remain our only\n\npriorities.\"\n\nThe smart money is that Davis still exits the Browns after this season, with both sides agreeing and the parties reaching a financial settlement on the rest of the coach's contract. Lerner is not of a mind, sources confirmed, to fire Davis, even with the team's poor performance this year. And Davis, those sources said, wasn't going to walk away from the money remaining on his contract.\nTo date, there have been no substantive discussions aimed at settling Davis' contract, although it will not be surprising if preliminary talks commence before the conclusion to the season.\n\"The people who thought that this whole thing was going to come Tuesday, with some resolution, forgot about the money elements involved here,\" one source said. \"Barring a miracle or a change of heart by the owner, [Davis] won't be back in '05, but there are a lot of issues to hash through. And what good was it going to do to fire him now?\"\nSince 1970, there have been 55 \"replacement\" coaches who took over teams during the season, and their aggregate winning percentage is just .313. It had been speculated that, if Davis exited before the end of the season, defensive coordinator Dave Campo, the former head coach of the \n, would assume the role of interim coach.\nSources said that Davis and Lerner met recently, perhaps even on Tuesday, to resolve the sense of urgency that had come to surround the situation in the wake of Sunday's loss to the \n. They essentially agreed that Davis' status would be reviewed shortly after the final regular-season game.\nDavis, 53, was hired in 2001 and has compiled a 24-35 record.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1930154"},

{"title": "Ravens tailback likely to serve 2-6 months", "text": "\nATLANTA -- While the deal will not be announced until some time next week, \n tailback \n has reached a tentative plea agreement that will allow him to avoid both a jury trial next month on drug charges and a potentially career-ending prison sentence.\nEven with the plea agreement, Lewis faces sanctions, perhaps severe, from the NFL, sources agreed. Lewis has violated the league substance-abuse policy on at least two previous occasions and was suspended without pay for four games in 2001, a season he missed anyway because of a knee injury suffered in training camp. He also could come under the purview of the NFL personal conduct policy.\nUnder terms of the that policy, a player is subject to review even if he enters \"a plea to a lesser ¬Ö offense.\" Punitive action from the NFL would be at the discretion of the commissioner and can range from a fine, to suspension, to banishment from the league.\nESPN's Chris Mortensen reported Sunday that sources have told him the NFL is expected to act promptly once the plea deal is sealed and Lewis faces a 2-4 game suspension, pending appeals.\nNFL spokesman Greg Aiello told The Associated Press Saturday that possible punishment would be based on the player's history and the facts of the case but declined to comment on what sanctions Lewis specifically could face.\nVarious sources from federal agencies and the NFL, and others with knowledge of the plea agreement, confirmed the deal. However, involved attorneys either did not return phone calls or declined comment and Lewis told the Baltimore Sun on Friday that he had no knowledge of the negotiations.\nOn Saturday, he told the AP, \"My lawyers will call me and let me know what's going on if something is going on. They haven't called me and let me know anything.\"\nMeanwhile, the case won't affect his preparation for the Ravens' game Monday night against Kansas City, Lewis said. \"This is what I do. This is my life. This is my career. That pretty much says it all.\"\nAn Atlanta native, Lewis is charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine and using a cell phone to plan a drug transaction. The charges are the result of an FBI investigation in the summer of 2000. If convicted, Lewis would have faced a sentence of at least 10 years, which essentially would have ended his NFL career.\nThe Sun reported the plea agreement in its Saturday editions. The original story concerning negotiations to keep Lewis out of court was published Friday by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Federal authorities confirmed Friday for ESPN.com that talks between prosecutors and Lewis' attorneys had been ongoing for a few weeks.\nOne source contended a resolution was not imminent, but clearly the discussions were on a faster track than he indicated. Other sources said Lewis likely will serve two to six months in prison, a halfway house or a combination of both.\n\"There would be no jail time that would interfere with his\n\ncareer,\" a source close to the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP.\nA key element to negotiations, sources said, was not only how much time Lewis might spend in prison but also when it would be served. It is likely, since he has signed off on the plea bargain, his sentence would be served during the NFL offseason.\nBecause the paperwork will not be filed until next week, when U.S. district judge Orinda Evans convenes a public hearing, the charges to which Lewis agreed are not yet certain. As presiding judge in the case, Evans must approve the plea agreement but is expected to do so.\nIn February, Lewis pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on $500,000 bond. His attorneys, the high-profile Atlanta tandem of Don Samuel and Ed Garland, staunchly reiterated their client's innocence. But the specter of a jury trial, scheduled for Nov. 1, and all the possibilities inherent in such a proceeding became the catalyst for the plea agreement. It is not known who initiated the negotiations.\nOne source said Friday that, as part of any deal, Lewis would \"almost beyond doubt\" have to provide the prosecution with testimony against his friend Angelo Jackson, who is facing similar charges. It is alleged that Lewis introduced Tomeka Richard to Jackson, a longtime buddy from his neighborhood. Richard was working with the FBI and posing as a drug dealer in a sting operation when she contacted the Ravens tailback in June 2000. Later that summer, Jackson allegedly met with Richard to plan a drug deal.\nRichard is a key witness but, if the case proceeds to trial, it is generally agreed the defense would vigorously attempt to impeach her credibility. Even while cooperating with the FBI, court and arrest records indicate, Richard continued to commit other crimes, most of them related to fraud.\nLewis might not be formally sentenced until Jackson's case is resolved.\nRavens coach Brian Billick said Saturday that talk of a plea deal has at least brought the possibility of closure.\n\"As we move along, the more we can bring specific definition to it, the better it is both for him personally and for this team,\" Billick told the AP, urging caution in judging Lewis.\n\"I would caution everybody before you cast judgment -- and I know you will anyway -- that you wait until all of the facts and all the proceedings. And it may take awhile.\"\nLewis, 25, was a first-round draft choice of the Ravens in 2000.

{"title": "LB Morris comes up big for Colts", "text": "\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Stop the presses. Wake the kids. Yeah, go ahead, rub your eyes a few times and then, for good measure, pinch yourself. And, hey, while you're at it, phone an astronomer and make certain the planet hasn't somehow been nudged off its axis.\nYep, the \n won another key divisional road game Sunday, and that is becoming the norm. Not surprisingly, the Indianapolis offense mustered up a late-game touchdown, with an impressive 74-yard trek in which the Colts bludgeoned a \n run defense previously thought to be impenetrable. There were, as always, the usual \n heroics and touchdowns by the other two-thirds of the \"triplets\" attack, wide receiver \n and tailback \n.\nBut here's the stunner and, no, folks, it's not a typo: When they handed out the game balls following the Colts' gutsy 24-17 victory over the heretofore undefeated Jags, coach Tony Dungy began with several defensive players.\nAnd you can bet middle linebacker \n, who authored the game's signature play, combining with weak-side 'backer \n to stuff Jacksonville tailback \n for no gain on a fourth-and-one from the Indianapolis 45-yard line with two minutes remaining, was at the top of the roll call.\nOn a day when the NFL's lowest-ranked offense faced its most porous defense, it was, thanks in large part to Morris, the \"D\" that came up biggest at the end. For Dungy, whose background is on the defensive side of the ball but who, ironically, has the benefit of the league's highest-octane attack, it was an appropriate outcome.\n\"It's hard for me sometimes,\" acknowledged Dungy, laughing. \"I'd still rather be out there on defense, trying to close the game out, you know? So this was a big game for our (defensive) guys. It was on them at the end and they made the plays you have to make.\"\nNone was bigger, of course, than Morris' stop of Taylor. It was, in fact, the second time in the game that Morris starred on a short-yardage play, having knocked backup tailback \n sideways on a fourth-and-one in the first quarter that stymied the Jags at the Indianapolis 24 on Jacksonville's initial possession.\nFor all its shortcomings, and they are many, this is an Indianapolis defense that seems to find a way to get a stop when the outcome is on the line. In the Colts' first victory of the season, at Tennessee, the unit shut down the Titans in the second half and cornerback \n had a critical interception in the end zone. Last week, when Green Bay was threatening to tie a game that had been more of a track meet all day, rookie corner \n forced a fumble, stripping Packers receiver \n of the ball.\nOn Sunday, it was the Indianapolis short-yardage defense that secured the victory.\nLittle-known, but very meaningful statistic, from the first four games: The Colts defense, as maligned as it has been, has now thwarted six third-and-one or fourth-and-one plays this season. Morris, the team's somewhat surprising first-round pick in 2000, has been in on at least four of those stops.\nJacksonville entered Sunday's big AFC South matchup having converted all four of its fourth-down tries in 2004. Then again, the Jaguars, who had the NFL's worst third-down conversion rate through three outings, moved the chains on eight of 15 occasions during this tense game.\nWhen push literally came to shove, however, the Jacksonville offensive line, which finished with both of its starting tackles on the sideline with injuries, couldn't carve out a critical crease against the Colts front seven.\nOn the first-quarter snap, the Jags tried a lead play off right guard, and Morris teamed up with defensive end \n to smother Toefield. On the game-saving play, the run went to the right A gap, with June getting just an arm on Taylor and then Morris stepping into the hole to clean up. The Taylor run was reviewed, called for by the replay official in the booth, but it was fairly obvious he was shy of the 44-yard line.\n\"Those are plays where, let's face it, no one is trying to fool anybody,\" said Morris, who finished with six tackles. \"I mean, there is zero trick stuff there, right? They're going to line up and do what they do, and we're going to line up and do what we do. It's just kind of a helmet on a helmet and no frills. Those are plays that kind of define a game.\"\nThey are plays that, lately at least, have defined Morris, a fifth-year veteran. There have been times when Morris has been knocked by some critics as being too slow, too short-armed, too limited physically. But on Sunday afternoon, the former Brigham Young star, a starter since his rookie season, was simply too tough.\nHe has a nice knack for scraping off blockers, shedding, getting to the ball. Morris may not pursue as well as some coaches would like, and his athleticism is dubious, but there is no denying his perseverance. Or that of the Colts, who for a second time in three weeks, were lauded by Dungy for their professionalism and maturity.\nIt was an afternoon when Indianapolis, and especially the defense, needed both qualities in pretty major doses.\nWhile the Colts offense posted 408 yards, Manning wasn't quite as sharp as in recent weeks, and it appeared he tried to be too fine with his passes at times. Indianapolis had touchdown drives of 75, 83 and 74 yards and, particularly early in the contest, Manning exposed the Jaguars' double coverage on wideouts Harrison and \n by going to slot receiver \n (eight catches, 97 yards) between the seams.\nBut there were some glitches -- two dropped passes, an overthrow, one interception on which Jacksonville rookie weak-side linebacker \n made an incredible effort to tip the ball back to himself -- that conspired to foil promising drives. The Colts did mix their formations beautifully in the second half, first coming with a three-wideout set and then going to the two-tight end base formation they have used so often in the past, to create some nifty holes for James, mostly on the trademark stretch play.\nThe usually-suspect Jacksonville offense, though, and quarterback \n made enough plays to hang close. The Jaguars had just six third-down conversions in 34 tries in their first three games. On Sunday, they were far more proficient in that, and just about every other phase, finishing with a season-best 337 yards.\nOf the Jags' 73 snaps, 35 originated on the Indianapolis side of the 50. They had a dozen plays inside the 30 and nine inside the 25. Remarkably, the Jaguars moved into Indianapolis territory on all nine offensive series. But four possessions ended in \n field goal tries, with three conversions.\nSuffice it to say, Jacksonville's performance in plus territory was a major negative. For the Indianapolis defense, on the other hand, the Jags' ball movement was a challenge that the unit was determined to overcome.\nSaid Colts defensive end \n: \"The key is always going to be keeping the other guys out of the end zone and then making the game-winning plays at the end. We did both those things today. People can (criticize) this defense all they want, but we feel like we're going to step up when it's time to step up. When we ran out on the field for that final (series), hey, it was where we all wanted to be, with a chance to shut them down and close this thing out.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1894363"},

Coming into the game, opponents were completing 69.7 percent of their passes. Quarterback ratings against them were 92.6 coming into the game.\nDespite that, the defense has given up only five touchdowns in four games. Opponents have scored only 49 points against them. What gives?\n\"I've always felt like pass yards are empty yards,\" Falcons coach Jim Mora said. \"I've just never been concerned about that, and I'm a defensive back coach by nature. It shows you are controlling the game, you are winning the game and they are having to throw it. I think yards are the most overrated statistic in football. I'll take points over yards. I think every coach in football would agree with me.\"\nMora said last week after Atlanta's 3-0 start that allowing opponents to complete 70 percent of their passes was no big deal because they play so much zone.\n\"They play some man to man, but they play off, and I was getting some matchups we were taking advantage of,\" Muhammad said. \"Anytime you can get some smaller corners on you, you got to take advantage.\"\nMuhammad is 6-2 and he was working on \n, who is 5-9. In the first half alone, Muhammad had 89 yards on four catches, including a 34- and a 23-yard catching over Mathis during the Panthers' only touchdown drive.\nFoster scored from the 1 in the first quarter to tie the score at 7-7.\nBut while the Falcons will give up yards through the air, they've been nasty along the defensive line. They have great pass rushers. \n is on fire with a league-leading seven sacks, including two against the Panthers. Defensive tackle Rod Coleman has three sacks from the inside. End \n is a three-sack guy. That pressure forces turnovers and the Panthers had three Sunday, including two deep in Falcons territory.\n\"I think turnovers are bad anywhere,\" Panthers coach John Fox said. \"We've had that problem in two games that we lost and not in the one that we've won. It's something we've got to clean up and do a better job with. I take full responsibility for that. It's something we have to get better at.\"\nOverall, the Panthers outgained the Falcons, 360-313. If you would have told Fox he'd have a quarterback throw for 308 yards in a game that was 13-10 well into the third quarter, he'd believe he'd win big.\nThat wasn't the case Sunday.\n\"I think they are a very good defense,\" Delhomme said. \"I always felt that they play hard up front. Give them credit. They caused some turnovers today that helped them.\"\nThe Panthers defense was equally frustrated. Though they held \n to only 10 completions for 148 yards, they were dominated on the ground. The Falcons had 40 rushes for 165 yards, and the Panthers proud defense was worn down at the end.\n\"We wanted to come in and establish the run game,\" Falcons halfback \n said. \"The offensive linemen's eyes just lit up as the game was going on. They love having a game like this. \n and I thrive off of them, and just run behind them.\"\nIt didn't help that linebacker \n played only one series because of back spasms. His replacement was \n, who isn't as quick and doesn't have as much range as Fields. They lost kick returner \n with a knee injury. His status is uncertain.\nWorse, the Panthers just can't seem to do anything against the Falcons when Vick is in the lineup.

{"title": "Williams' attorney worked wonders", "text": "\n' attorney David Cornwell did a great job negotiating a way for him to return to the NFL. The next problem is going to be seeing if Williams is going to agree to the terms.\nCornwell has worked out a proposal in which Williams can be reinstated by Dec. 13 or 14 and then serve a four-game suspension for violations of the league's substance abuse policy. While the return would come late enough that he wouldn't wear a \n uniform this season, or most likely ever again, it would put him in play for next season to a team willing to make a trade.\nThe NFL and Cornwell haven't finalized the deal, but then neither has Ricky. The question going around Tuesday night is if he's willing to agree to the proposal. Williams is currently attending a holistic medicine school 40 miles outside of Sacramento and isn't the best at communicating his true intentions.\nHe would need to accept this concept for commissioner Paul Tagliabue to approve it for the league. That may not be easy.\nIn the end, the terms of their settlement between Williams' attorney and the league are fair. He failed a drug test last December that made him eligible for a four-game suspension. Williams challenged the test, but before the challenge warranted a hearing, he opted to retire July 25. By retiring, his four-game suspension became a one-year suspension.\nWilliams traveled the world, from China to Australia, living in tents and in the wilderness. He didn't deal with his career or financial matters. The Dolphins sued him for breach of contract and he now owes the Dolphins $8 million.\nCornwell got involved this fall and spent numerous hours negotiating with the NFL, which wanted to have Williams suspended well into next season if he wanted to return. First, Cornwell heard from Williams that he wanted to play.\nThe attorney submitted a couple of proposals that basically used the 2004 season as time served. Last week, Cornwell made a trip to New York, and the pending solution appeared to be the fairest.\nFor Williams, it allows him to re-enter the NFL the minute the 2004 season is completed. It also keeps him in the drug program as an offender under a four-game suspension as opposed to a year's suspension. The next time Williams fails a drug test or misses a scheduled test, he would be subject to a one-year suspension.\nFor the Dolphins, it gives them a trade asset. Had Williams had the uncertainty about his playing status still lingering, he would have been impossible to trade. Now, the Dolphins can shop him in trades in March and he could end up with, possibly, the Raiders.\nFor the NFL, it keeps its drug policy intact. Williams violated its terms and missed the entire 2004 season by the way he mishandled his affairs.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1930543"},

And appropriately enough, most of what transpired in the hard-fought division loss to the \n also validated that, despite some uneven moments in Jacksonville's first three games of the season, Leftwich certainly has the talent to take his offense to much greater heights.\nIn what was clearly his best performance of this young season, Leftwich completed 29 of  41 passes for 318 yards, with one touchdown pass, zero interceptions and an impressive efficiency rating of 101.5. The yardage represented the second-most of his career and it was the third straight contest in which Leftwich did not throw an interception.\nThen again, the only numbers that mattered to Leftwich were the ones on the scoreboard and, justifiably, the former Marshall star had reason for his obvious disappointment.\n\"I'm not looking for a good statistical game,\" said Leftwich, who has become the face for this quickly rebuilding franchise. \"I'm looking for a good win.\"\nHad the Jags offense found some answers on the plus side of the field, Leftwich and his emerging young team, indeed, might have discovered themselves still undefeated. But the offensive failures, the most glaring of which was getting into the end zone only one time despite venturing into Indianapolis territory on all nine possessions, demonstrated this is a unit that still has room for growth.\nThen again, if Leftwich can build on Sunday's performance, there is some chance that the learning curve could be accelerated. Entering the game, Leftwich had thrown for a paltry average of 130.3 yards per outing, with a top outing of 147 yards. Only once in those first three games, had he completed more than 50 percent of his attempts.\nSpeaking to personnel officials around the NFL, and several players from teams that had faced Leftwich in the first month of the season, the consensus was that the youngster was both uneven and uncomfortable. On Sunday, though, Jacksonville offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave put Leftwich into his comfort zone, and the results were encouraging.\nMore so than in any other game this year, Leftwich operated from a shotgun formation, the set from which he had worked almost exclusively in college. There is some doubt, even among Jacksonville officials, about Leftwich's ability to work from under center. And if Sunday showed anything, it might have suggested that Musgrave and head coach Jack Del Rio lean a bit more heavily on the shotgun for the rest of  the 2004 campaign.\nSaid one of Leftwich's teammates after the game: \"He just gets into a rhythm so much better. His confidence is pretty obvious. He gets on a little bit of a roll and things seem to be easier for him, from a recognition standpoint, in the 'gun,' you know?\"\nThe raw numbers from Sunday certainly seem to indicate that.\nWhen in the shotgun, unofficially, Leftwich completed 24 of 30 passes for 283 yards, with one touchdown. His three longest completions, including a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver \n, all came when working from the shotgun. But the Jags gained just 12 yards on five rushes out of the shotgun, notable because their coaches feel the skills of tailback \n are diminished a bit if Leftwich isn't under center.\nLeftwich was sacked one time but rarely pressured beyond that, even after Jacksonville lost both of its starting tackles, \n and \n, to injuries. It is believed that Pearson tore at least one ligament in his right knee and will miss the rest of the season.\nBeyond that, the most notable wounds to the Jacksonville offense were self-inflicted. The Jaguars had 35 snaps on the Indianapolis side of the 50-yard line and nine from inside the 25-yard line, but settled four times for field goal attempts. The Jags lost one fumble and, most egregiously, were stuffed twice on fourth-and-one plays, one from the Indianapolis 24, the other on the Colts 45 on their last series.\nBut the game also served notice that rookie wide receivers \n and \n are emerging playmakers, that there is some burgeoning weaponry here and that this is an offense with growth potential.\n\"If we can hang together, we're going to be pretty good, I think,\" said Wilford, who had six catches for 56 yards. \"I mean, for Byron, the sky is definitely the limit. And I think we will all get better with him.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1894422"},
{"title": "Ravens limited on offense without Lewis", "text": "\n \n While the defense will attempt to slow down New England's star tailback, the Ravens will have to survive without theirs.\n\n\nBaltimore travels to New England without star running back, \n, who has an ankle injury that could keep him out for more than a week. The Patriots made a bold move this offseason trading for \n, who has allowed the Patriots to use more play-action passing plays in their offense.\nWill Dillon's presence and Lewis' absence be the difference in Sunday's showdown between the two teams in Foxboro? Probably. Dillon is averaging 4.8 yards a carry and is only two yards shy of 1,000 yards. His ability to hit holes hard allows quarterback \n to work more games against the linebackers, hoping to make them bite on play-action fakes.\nQuarterback \n, who has actually performed better over the last month, has been forced to increase his production. Since Lewis has missed time because of a two-game suspension and injuries, the Ravens have allowed Boller to throw more and challenge defenses with down-field passing.\nStill Lewis, who has 651 yards on 159 carries, is one of the league's best power runners. He wears down defenders with his hard, physical style. \n did well filling in for Lewis with 370 yards and a 4.4-yard average, but it's going to be hard for him to do what Lewis does.\nThe Ravens, who are 7-3, have the league's toughest closing schedule. They pulled out a big road victory two weeks ago in New York by beating the Jets, 20-17,  even though the Jets could have scored a short touchdown in the final minutes of regulation. They have December road trips to Indianapolis and Pittsburgh.\nAnd the Patriots are still considered the league's best team. Coach Bill Belichick did an unbelievable job of mixing man and zone coverages for road trips against high powered offenses such as the Chiefs and Rams, and pulled out convincing victories.\nThe return of \n gives the offense more firepower because of his downfield speed and ability to make big plays after catching the ball.\nFor a game such as this, the Ravens need all of their weapons. Unfortunately they don't have them.\nIt will be tough.\n \n The good news is that the Giants are at home. The bad news is they are playing the NFC's best team and if they lose, they are eliminated from contention for the NFC East crown. Rookie quarterback \n did several things well in his first start against the Falcons. For one, he didn't take a ton of sacks last week. \n was sacked 24 times during his first four starts and had 39 sacks in nine starts. Manning got rid of the ball quickly and only had one. But getting rid of the ball too quickly led him to having a 43.5 completion percentage. In a league of 60-percent plus passers, that's not good enough, and a repeat of that won't give the Giants much of a chance against the NFC's best team. The Eagles come into this game down another offensive lineman. Guard \n is out with a sprained medial collateral knee ligament will be replaced by \n. Coach Andy Reid has been patching the guard position all season since they lost first-round choice \n for the season. \n has also been banged up. The Eagles won the season opener against the Giants, 31-17, and now the Giants play them without Warner at quarterback and \n on the defensive line. With a rookie at quarterback, the Giants are lacking key playmakers to counter the Eagles.\n \n The Packers are on a roll. They have won five games in a row and they have done a lot despite adversity. \n has had a lot of family problems, but he's having one of his best seasons. He's completed 64.9 percent of his passes and has 19 touchdown passes. Last week against the Texans, he brought the team from a 10-point deficit despite having three halfbacks, including \n, out with injuries. The Rams didn't show the same resilience in a road loss to the Bills last week. Coach Mike Martz complained blocks on Rams cornerbacks forced three injuries that left the secondary depleted. \n and the Bills offense picked them apart in what turned out to a 34-17 win. Now, the weather will be colder and road games will be tougher for the Rams. The return of defensive tackle \n from an early-season knee injury has improved the Packers run defense. While the Packers may not have much of a running game because of injuries, they still have Favre. A Favre-\n showdown could be fun the watch, but the Rams defense now suddenly looks the more vulnerable of the two.\n \n Jacksonville coach Jack Del Rio was hurt when Vikings coach Mike Tice didn't give him the defensive coordinator job with the Vikings a couple of years ago. Del Rio went off to the Ravens and then emerged as the Jaguars head coach. The former teammates remain good friends, but this a vital game for both teams. The Jaguars should have \n back at quarterback after missing two games with a knee injury, but things aren't as good with the offense as they were before he rested. Critics are saying the offense is getting too conservative. One of the big problems has been the receivers haven't played well. Rookie \n has only 19 catches and isn't open much. Rookie \n was deactivated last week even though he's a big target. That's fine for the Vikings, who are trying to find their confidence on defense. What the Vikings can't afford is a fast start by the Jaguars offense. Too many times in the past month, the Vikings have been two touchdowns down in the first half. Even though he's starting the week as doubtful because of his hamstring, \n is expected to return. He had a good Monday workout, and having him back should open up more big plays for the offense.\n \n Even though there has been a dramatic improvement in the defense, the Chargers know they don't matchup as well against good passing teams. The Chiefs are a great passing team and they are at home. But poor defensive play is killing the Chiefs and putting the offense into horrible positions. This might be one of the worst tackling defenses in football. Despite the coaching of defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham, the Chiefs allow too many offensive players to run free. That's good news for a Chargers offense that is hot. \n looks great now that he's had an extra week to rest a groin injury. The one-two threat of tight end \n and wide receiver \n is hard for teams to cover, and the Chiefs defense has problems matching up against good tight ends. Still, this contest and the Jan. 2 meeting in San Diego are dangerous games for the Chargers. The Chiefs at 3-7 are now spoilers. They won't have \n and don't have much of a running game without him. But as good as the Chiefs passing game is, they couldn't score more than 19 points against a Patriots secondary that was filled with an undrafted free agent rookie, a former practice squad player and a wide receiver playing cornerback. This is a victory former Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer needs.\n \n The Bills have won four of their past six games after an 0-4 start, but they haven't won a road game this year. They know they are hitting the Seahawks at the right time. A knee surgery to \n and a wrist operation to \n leaves the defense without their best two linebackers. The receiving corps is down wide receiver \n for the next four games because of a drug suspension. Right tackle \n is in Mike Holmgren's doghouse and didn't even play last week. The Seahawks played poorly against the Dolphins but won thanks to a dumb interception by \n. Seahawks defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes does have defensive end \n back to help the pass rush, and everyone knows Drew Bledsoe struggles against a good pass rush. The Rams didn't pressure him last week and Bledsoe picked the Rams defense apart. There is an emotional tie for Bledsoe, who played across the state at Washington State. He knows his starting days in Buffalo might be numbered, so he wants to use this rare return to his homestate as a springboard for next year.\n\n\n  \n \n returns to the Steelers offense at the right time. \n won't be available for quarterback \n because of a hamstring injury, so the Steelers will be trying to run even more, knowing their deep threat isn't going to play. Roethlisberger is 8-0 and has mastered every challenge. This week, he will be facing a team that blitzes more than any in the NFL. New Redskins defensive coordinator Gregg Williams brings the heat with his many blitzes, and even though Roethlisberger does well against the blitz, he hasn't faced a team that blitzes every other play. \n makes his second start for Joe Gibbs' struggling offense, which suddenly lost it's running game. \n gained only 37 yards last week on 17 carries against the Eagles. The Redskins line lost its best guard, \n, because of a hamstring injury. Steelers defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau won't have \n to help out his blitzing schemes because of a groin tear that should end his season. No problem. He'll blitz inside linebacker \n, who is having a Pro Bowl season. Farrior is making more big plays than any inside linebacker in football.\n \n Can things get any worse for Saints coach Jim Haslett, a good friend of Falcons coach Jim Mora? Saints owner Tom Benson said the Saints played like a bunch of high-schoolers against the Broncos and that it was one of the worst performances he's seen since owning the team. Rumors of a Haslett firing had to be extinguished early in the week. Still, Haslett is having a tough time motivating this defense, which is the worst in football. His offense is making too many dumb mistakes. The Falcons, meanwhile, are winning despite the limitations of their offense. \n is carrying the team with his running and throwing, but the Falcons offense isn't pretty to watch. They don't get the ball to the wide receivers. It's usually a few Vick throws to tight end \n, a Vick run here or there and a few handoffs. It works. The Falcons are 8-2 and should have the NFC South wrapped up within two weeks.\n \n Wonder what surprises Dennis Green has this week? Last week, he benched starting quarterback Josh McCown and went with \n, who didn't play particularly well. Every week, Green comes up with a surprise. King is expected to start again, and the Cardinals play well at home. Or it is that opponents play bad in Arizona? The Cardinals are 3-1 at home even though their home crowd is smaller than a \n tailgating party. The Jets are just trying to survive until \n comes back in two weeks. \n will run a conservative offense featuring \n and \n, who is finally getting some action. Martin is playing with a banged up knee, so Jordan may have to do a little bit more.\n \n Cleveland coach Butch Davis has been assured he won't be fired if he loses but the writing is on the wall. Davis is out after the season if not before. The Browns are in depression. Their season has slipped away at 3-7 and fans are furious. Owner Randy Lerner is making public apologies to fans for the team's horrible performances, and things should only get worse. \n will start at quarterback because \n has a damaged shoulder and back. To be honest, I'm surprised he lasted this long because that offensive lineis terrible. Holcomb's timing couldn't be worse because left tackle \n was lost for the season with a knee injury. The Bengals had seven sacks against a pretty good Steelers offensive line, and Holcomb isn't the most mobile quarterback. For the Bengals, this is a game of pride. Marvin Lewis was furious at the Bengals poor effort last week against the Steelers. Bengals players like Lewis and should respond. Can we say the same about the Browns and Davis? We'll find out Sunday.\n \n Won't this be a classic? It's the battle for the first pick in the draft. The Dolphins stayed on the West Coast for a week prepping for this showdown. Of the two, the Dolphins are playing better. The 49ers continue to get worse. The injuries have caught up to them, and their performance level has dropped each week. They haven't been within 10 points of an opponent in the last four games of their five-game losing streak. The Dolphins played hard for interim coach Jim Bates last week against the Seahawks but the same scenario re-emerged. There wasn't enough offense and \n threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown. Here's a thought. \n is over in Oakland visiting his sister and goes to school learning holistic medicine about an hour away. Maybe he can come by for an inspirational talk to the guys.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&page=/ten/2004week12"},
{"title": "Vick beats, aggravates Panthers", "text": "\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- In the NBA, there were the Michael Jordan Rules. The \n believe the NFL has a different set of rules regarding \n. They believe the league is out to protect him.\n\"As a defensive player, do I think he's overprotected?\" Panthers defensive tackle \n said. \"Yes. We are are out there getting cut left and right. But that's what this NFL is all about. The NFL wants touchdowns. They want their exciting players to be successful. They are not going to let you touch him.\"\nMaybe there are Michael Vick Rules, but let's say this right now, against the Panthers, Michael Vick rules. He's 4-0 against them following Sunday's 27-10 domination at Bank of America Stadium. In three quarters, the Panthers had three personal foul penalties against Vick. Emotions became so hot that after Panthers linebacker \n drew a personal foul penalty for hitting Vick, the emotional quarterback responded with a head butt of his own.\nThat headbutt drew a Bernie Kukar penalty flag and each player on each side grabbed an opponent in what looked almost to be the beginnings of a hockey fight. Panthers players and fans waited eagerly as Kukar and crew tried to sort out the mess. They hoped for a Vick ejection. Instead, they got more Vick dejection.\nVick bounced back from the feistiness to control the clock and dominate the rest of the game. While the Panthers defense remains one of the best in football, Vick is in their heads. Jerry Richardson may have the ownership of this one-time expansion team by bringing NFL football to Charlotte, but for the time being, Vick owns the Panthers, and now, with a 4-0 start, they may own the NFC South.\n\"That's just the competitiveness on both sides,\" Vick said. \"There's going to be jabbing and guys out there mouthing. It's just part of the game. It's something that doesn't' happen all of the time I'm pretty sure. They don't have that all the time and it's something I won't get into all the time. I definitely don't invite it. All of that (is) provoked.\"\nThe Panthers-Falcons battle is growing into a pretty good rivalry even though it's one-sided in favor of Vick at the moment. While the Panthers defense drives most opponents crazy, Vick tends to do the driving on them.\nAs expected, Panthers coach John Fox came up with a few new wrinkles to contain Vick. Unlike the Cardinals, who occasionally put five defensive linemen to contain his running, the Panthers cheated linebackers to the line of scrimmage. On one play, they put linebacker \n on the line standing up between the defensive tackle and defensive end. On other plays, they put an outside linebacker along the line as an outside end.\nUnfortunately for the Panthers, the strategy played into the hands of what the Falcons wanted to do on their offensive script. Jim Mora's plan was to balance the run and the pass but get the passes off quickly. Once Vick spotted the extra commitment along the line, he had open receivers.\n\"It opened up for me,\" tight end \n said. \"I caught the ball early because they tried to do a little bit of Arizona, which is putting extra down linemen in. The coaches were showing us the looks that we had. When you stack the box, you've got to throw the football.\"\nVick spotted the alignments beautifully and went to work. He completed his first seven passes for 118 yards. Four of those passes went to Crumpler for 75 yards and enabled the Falcons to score a touchdown and two field goals in their first three possessions. \n mixed in 74 yards on his first 11 carries, and the Falcons held a 13-7 lead with 14:10 left in the first half.\n\"It opened up the passing game downfield,\" Vick said of five- and six-man commitments. \"It allowed us to go play action. We were able to hit Crumpler on a couple of passes. We were able to get \n on a couple of down field passes. We were able to convert some third downs, which we haven't been doing too well.\"\nMora warned officials before the game this would be intense and physical. Kukar's officiating crew kept responding with flags. The Falcons received 11 penalties for 106 yards. The Panthers had 10 for 91. Before long, neither offense had continuity because the penalties were disrupting the flow of the game. It became a tightly called game, which the Panthers believed worked against them.\n\"Michael Vick is the face of the NFL right now, so they aren't going to allow something to happen to him,\" Buckner said. \"You know how much he means to the NFL. He sells out stadiums. He sells out jerseys. He's got commercials. Everybody wants to be like Michael Vick. He's the NFL right now. They are going to protect him. He's the quarterback. He's being extra protected.\"\nOf course, this game was getting out of hand anyway. Both quarterbacks knew it was going to be physical. Falcons linebacker \n got a roughing the passer on the Panthers' second offensive possession. Backup Panthers defensive tackle \n got the Panthers' first of three fouls against Vick in the second quarter. It was roughing the passer.\nThings got real rough in the third quarter. Panthers defensive end \n allegedly roughed Vick for a 15-yard penalty four plays into the second half. On the next possession, linebacker Short blitzed and drew a flag for unnecessary roughness. Vick retaliated.\n\"I was blitzing on the outside, and he had a good play fake and I was on him so quickly that I didn't realize he had handed off,\" Short said. \"He was running to carry out his fake. I was standing there. Either he ran into me or I ran into him. I don't know what happened, but I got the flag.\"\nWithin a few seconds, he got a Vick headbutt, and a melee followed. Naturally, the Falcons players rallied around Vick.\n\"It was intense, and everyone got emotional and everyone really got into it,\" Dunn said. \"Guys were talking a little too much instead of just playing the game. You can then get out of character. That's when you get away from your game.\"\nWithin a few plays, Dunn's \n legs cramped up and he had to give way to backup \n. Vick calmed down and let Duckett and his run wear down the Panthers defense.\nMeanwhile, the Panthers offense got out of sync. \n threw a fourth-quarterback interception that \n returned 35 yards for a touchdown. Duckett scored from four yards out in the fourth quarter, and suddenly this game was a blowout.\n\"I think that the officials did an outstanding job of protecting Michael Vick,\" Mora said. \"I think they really did. I give them credit for that. I love Mike's passion. He gets up and he head butts a linebacker. I would rather that it not happen, but I'm not going to tell him not to. I love the energy, the passion and the emotion as long as it doesn't go any further than that. Mike's a fighter. He's a competitor and a winner. He was probably tired of being hit.\"\nOne thing is for sure, the Panthers are tired of Vick. He owns them.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&id=1894500"},
{"title": "Packers get backup QB for disgruntled CB", "text": "\n got his wish Monday when he\n\nwas traded to the \n for a second-round pick in\n\n2005 and a backup quarterback.\n\"It's time to move on,\" \n coach/general manager Mike\n\nSherman said.\nSince ending his holdout without retracting his trade request three weeks ago, McKenzie has been paid more than $485,000 but has played just nine snaps, all against Chicago. That has led fans -- and teammates -- to wonder whether he was still holding out but getting paid anyway.\nThe recalcitrant cornerback sat out the last two games with a\n\nmysterious hamstring injury. He was left home when the Packers\n\ntraveled to Indianapolis two weeks ago and wasn't on the sideline\n\nSunday when the Packers lost to the \n at home.\n\"Mission accomplished,\" McKenzie's agent, Drew Rosenhaus told\n\nThe Associated Press. \"It's important to relay that there's no\n\nhard feelings on Mike's behalf. He's obviously grateful they were\n\nable to work out a deal, and there's certainly not going to be any\n\nbackbiting or any negativity on our behalf.\"\nRosenhaus said McKenzie will play under the terms of his current\n\ncontract, but he hopes to have talks with Saints general manager\n\nMickey Loomis soon about an upgrade.\n\"[Loomis] understands the dynamics that went into Mike's\n\nsituation: His contract was obviously an issue,\" Rosenhaus said.\n\n\"We hope to get that resolved; whether that happens this season or\n\nin the winter, I'm not going to make that an issue. We are\n\ncertainly not going to try to squeeze the Saints right now in\n\nregard to the contract.\"\nThe Packers acquired quarterback \n, 25, and the\n\nsecond-round selection in the 2005 draft in return for McKenzie,\n\n28, and a future conditional draft choice. The Packers have been\n\ninterested in O'Sullivan since the Saints took him in the sixth\n\nround of the 2002 draft out of Cal-Davis.\nTheir interest was heightened when \n and backup \n were injured Sunday. Favre has a mild concussion and is\n\nexpected to practice this week and extend his record starting\n\nstreak to 213 games, counting playoffs, against Tennessee next\n\nweek. But Pederson was undergoing further tests Monday on his ribs\n\nand kidneys.\nThe deal is the Packers' first midseason trade in 23 years\n\ninvolving active players from both teams.\nMcKenzie, who is earning $2.75 million this year in the middle\n\nseason of a five-year, $17.1 million deal he signed in January\n\n2002, became upset when several cornerbacks of lesser talent\n\nsurpassed him in compensation this offseason.\nMcKenzie instructed agent Brian Parker to seek a contract\n\nrenegotiation in February, converting a $200,000 workout bonus into\n\ntwo $100,000 roster bonuses due in April and June and removing a\n\nde-escalator clause from the contract he signed in 2002.\nAs the Packers worked to comply with the request, McKenzie said\n\nhe wanted to be traded instead. Green Bay denied his plea on April 6 and two weeks later drafted cornerbacks \n and \n with their first two selections.\nParker terminated his working relationship with McKenzie in May,\n\nand the cornerback hired Rosenhaus, his fifth representative in his six-year NFL career.\nMcKenzie, a starter for Green Bay since his rookie year, has 15 career interceptions. He comes off one of his most productive seasons with four interceptions, 58 tackles (55 solo) and 20 passes broken up.\nHe was Green Bay's best defender last year and Sherman could\n\nhave kept him beyond the Oct. 19 trade deadline to get one more\n\nyear out of him. But McKenzie had become even more of a loner in\n\nthe locker room and Sherman decided to cut ties now.\nHow are the Packers (1-3) better off without their best cover\n\ncornerback?\n\"Well, I just think from having things cleaned up,\" Sherman\n\nsaid. \"As I said, from the outside in, the focus that's been put\n\non that, everything that Mike did or didn't do was well-documented\n\nevery day.

It would be a\n\nstretch to say Sanders has mellowed at age 37, but his perception\n\nof what is important certainly seems to have changed.\nIn his prime, when he went to eight Pro Bowls as one of the most dynamic players in the NFL, Sanders never would have let an hamstring injury rob him of the opportunity to make an\n\ninterception or two on Monday night.\nBut things are different now.\n\"It's up to my legs,\" he said last week. \"We don't really\n\nwant to rush things. We have a journey here, not a sprint.\"\nIt's the same philosophy he carried into Cincinnati one week\n\nearlier after getting hurt on Sept. 19. Yet one couldn't help\n\nbelieving Sanders merely passed on facing the Bengals in order to\n\nbe ready for prime time against the Chiefs.\nHe scoffed at that suggestion, insisting that Monday night\n\nfootball is no different from Sunday afternoon football.\n\"Every game is prime time, every game is a big game. Games\n\ndon't have a bigger meaning to me; every game is the same,\"\n\nSanders said. \"Every game I step out there on the field I get my\n\nopponent's best. So just because the game is slated to be on Monday\n\nnight, it doesn't matter to me. Even when I'm at practice, I get my\n\nopponent's best.\"\nSince his return, Sanders has had little opportunity to shine as\n\nthe Ravens' fifth defensive back on passing downs. Cleveland didn't\n\ntest him in the opener, and he left the game against Pittsburgh\n\nafter chasing down \n on a long pass that fell\n\nincomplete.\nSanders returned a punt 23 yards in that game, but was penalized\n\n15 yards for removing his helmet on the field after the play. His\n\nstatistics after three games are hardly Pro Bowl worthy: One\n\ntackle, one pass defensed and two punt returns for 28 yards.\nYet he acted insulted when asked if had something to prove\n\nMonday night.\n\"I don't have to prove nothing to nobody. Please,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got to be kidding me. I didn't come back to play football\n\nto prove anything. I think the limited time I've been out there on\n\nthe field, or even practiced, I proved I could play the game at a\n\nhigh level.\"\nSanders' value to the Ravens transcends his ability to make big\n\nplays. He has become another coach on the practice field, sharing\n\nhis knowledge of the game with those possessing far less\n\nexperience.\n\"He means a lot to me. He's taught me so much about this game,\n\nand he's going to teach me a lot more,\" safety \n said.\n\n\"It's a daily process with Big Bro ... and he knows we're ready\n\nfor him to come back and do his thing.\"\nSanders joined the Ravens because he believes the team has a\n\ndecent shot at reaching the Super Bowl. He wanted to come along for\n\nthe ride, and so far it's been a blast.\n\"It's been unbelievable. I think the guys think the old man is\n\nplaying around too much, because I'm having such a good time,\" he\n\nsaid. \"Not only on the field, but off the field, when we go out to\n\neat, the meetings. I want to take advantage of all the situations\n\nin the time that I have left.\"", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=1895159"},
{"title": "Morning After: Defensive points", "text": "\nAfter three weeks of basically hiding out on the side of a milk carton, the defensive touchdown was back in vogue on Sunday, with three interceptions returned for scores and three fumbles also run back into the end zone. Uh, hey, guys, it was about time. Through the first three weekends of regular-season play, there were only 11 defensive touchdowns (six via interception and five on fumbles), far below the pace set a year ago. Heading into the Kansas City-Baltimore matchup on Monday night, the four-week defensive scoring is still behind the '03 mark of 22 touchdowns via interception (18) or fumble (four) returns, but maybe Sunday will serve as a catalyst for aggressive, ball-hawking defenders to start taking it \"to the house\" again with some degree of regularity.\nIn Sunday games, Atlanta cornerback \n, \n cornerback \n and Pittsburgh strong safety \n all scored on interception returns. The fumble returns for touchdowns came from New England defensive end \n, Arizona strong safety \n and Houston linebacker \n.\nJust in case you're missing the trend here, we'll bludgeon you over the head with it: All six franchises that scored on defense Sunday won their respective games. All six defensive scores either broke open the games in which they occurred or helped to secure the victory. \"It's a backbreaker,\" said Miami quarterback \n, speaking in general terms of defensive returns for touchdowns. \"It's one of the worst (momentum) swings you can have, really.\" Fiedler could, of course, address the issue from firsthand experience on Sunday, since Abraham's 66-yard theft-and-run was the signature play in a victory that permitted the Jets to go to 3-0 for just the third time in club history. The nine-year veteran corner made a perfect read on Fiedler's pass attempt for fullback \n in the right flat, jumping the pattern, making the \"pick\" and then racing down the sideline.\nSo why haven't we witnessed more of those kinds of electrifying defensive plays in the first month of the 2004 campaign? In part because, while coordinators have been blitz-crazy in the opening four weeks, that mode of aggression has not carried over much to the defenders in the \"back end,\" where cornerbacks in particular have been way too cautious. Three veteran corners to whom we spoke last week suggested the new emphasis on illegal contact has turned some secondary players timid. Noted one cornerback: \"Let's just say some guys have become (sissies). And the coaches haven't helped a lot, either, to tell you the truth.\"\nBut, apparently, the defensive backfield fraternity must have dispatched a memo to all loyal and dues-paying brothers before this weekend's slate of games. For the first time all season, judging from the replays, defensive backs were gamblin' and ramblin'. And it was nice to see. Last year, there was clearly a scoring mind-set among defensive players and everyone wanted to get into the touchdown act. Maybe that philosophy was rekindled some on Sunday. Through four weeks, defenses are suddenly on pace to notch 74 touchdowns. That is just a tick below the 77 defensive scores of a year ago. But the pace for interception scores is currently only 39, far below the 58 interception runbacks for touchdowns in 2003.\nThe fumble runbacks this season, it should be noted in fairness, are up dramatically. At the current pace, there would be 35 fumble runbacks for scores, nearly double the 19 from the '03 season. In that vein, maybe the neatest score of Sunday came from Seymour, who scooped up a fumble forced by linebacker \n and lumbered (there really is no other verb that so precisely described it) to his first-ever touchdown. \"I thought that I was going to die,\" Seymour said of the touchdown that clinched the Patriots' record 18th win in a row.\nOne more note on the turnover touchdowns: The Dolphins quarterbacks have now thrown more touchdown passes to the opposition than to their own receivers.\nSleight of hand\n\nYeah, we know, we doth gush a little too much about \n in this spot at times. So, yes, guilty as charged. But guess what? We're probably not going to stop any time soon. The latest object of our admiration for the \n star is one that has been cited several times during his career, and that is his ballhandling acumen. But let's give it a bit of a twist because, while everyone else writes about Manning's brilliant play-action fakes in the Colts' passing game, we think his legerdemain contributes mightily to the Indy running attack, as well.\nThere was perhaps no better example of that than on Sunday, as the Colts gashed what is maybe the NFL's best defense against the run to the tune of 117 yards. Now that might not sound like much real estate pounded out by the Colts runners, unless one considers the \n entered the critical AFC South showdown with a reputation for jamming up everything between the tackles. And, in a sense, therein lies the key. Much of Indianapolis' ground yardage came on the staple running play of the Tom Moore-designed offense, the \"stretch\" play. It is a play, always run well by \n, that does just what it suggests: It stretches a defense horizontally and permits James to find the soft spot in the front seven, then turn decisively up the field.\nSo what does Manning's sleight of hand have to do with the success of the \"stretch\" play, you say? Well, because Manning sets up the play by running so much of the Indianapolis passing paradigm off action similar to the \"stretch\" run. \"He just has the ability to freeze you,\" said Jacksonville middle linebacker and former Colts standout \n. \"I mean, I've seen it for years, and it's still hard for me to tell if he has the ball in his hands or if he has given it to 'Edge.' That split second of hesitation he plants in your mind makes a big difference.\"\nIn fact, it made a huge difference in the Colts' game-winning, 74-yard touchdown drive. Indianapolis ran eight times in the 13-play march, and 25 of the 36 rushing yards on the possession came on the \"stretch\" play. Unofficially, nearly two-thirds of James' game-high 83 yards came on the signature running play, and most of that was set up by the illusion Manning creates. A great master of detail, the Colts quarterback really has revived a lost art with his ballhandling skills. Manning has closely watched video of some of the game's best play-faking quarterbacks -- Boomer Esiason, Steve DeBerg, Dave Krieg -- and he is now clearly in their league.\nBy the way, the play-fakes have served Manning pretty nicely in the passing game, too, of late. In the last two games, both of which we covered and charted, Manning completed 24 of 35 passes off of play-action, for 355 yards, with five touchdown passes and one interception. It is a skill, the play-fake, that other quarterbacks in the NFL just ignore. But when Manning is just dangling the ball out there, teasing and tempting the defense as if the pigskin were some kind of carrot on a stick, it's tough for the opposition not to bite.\nBack to the blitz\n\nCongratulations to the \n organization, and in particular to general manager Charley Casserly and head coach Dom Capers, for finally cobbling together the  franchise's first two-game winning streak. It took 36 games, the longest ever for a modern era expansion franchise to achieve back-to-back wins, but they've got to be feeling a tad better about themselves in Houston right about now.\nUh, yes, we know that this means quarterback \n can now get a haircut after about 12 months of letting his onetime buzzed 'do grow out like a rat's nest. That angle has been overplayed so, with that scant mention of things coiffure-related, let's bury it.\nMore interesting to us than what figures to be the most scrutinized shearing since Delilah took the scissors to Samson's potent locks was the manner in which Capers and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio got back to their blitzing roots. We have been a bit critical in this space over the lack of a Texans pass rush, particularly considering that the Capers 3-4 blueprint had historically been one that \"schemed up\" sack opportunities. Well, from the get-go on Sunday, the Texans were out to get Oakland quarterback \n by going after him more aggressively.\nThe upshot: Collins, taking over for the injured \n, tossed up three interceptions (including a pair to Houston first-round cornerback \n) and also lost a pair of fumbles. The last four Oakland offensive series of the game, in fact, concluded in turnovers.\nSo while they are celebrating the modest two-game winning streak down in Houston, we're celebrating the return of the blitz to the Texans' defense. And, maybe, the return of \n to the starting lineup on a regular basis. The team's starter in his rookie year, and Houston's inaugural season, Wells lost his job to \n in '03. But with Davis nursing a sprained ankle, and having fumbled four times in the first three games, Wells got a start Sunday and powered his way for 105 yards. Wells isn't as physically gifted a back as Davis, but he dusted off the cobwebs some last week when the Houston starter was injured, then dusted the Oakland defense Sunday afternoon.\nSaints marching to nowhere\n\nIn our heart of hearts, we could feel it coming, honest. So when the franchise that arguably handles prosperity worse than any other in the league laid an egg in the Arizona desert on Sunday afternoon, we weren't altogether shocked. With a chance to go to 3-1, and pretty much narrow the NFC South chase to themselves and the archrival \n, the \n authored a pretty predictable pratfall.\nAnd so we are now making it official: We love the Saints' talent, we like their front office and coaching staff, but we are permanently off the bandwagon. If tradition holds true, that means the Saints will probably rip off about an eight-game winning streak, but even that feat would not be sufficient to get us back on board. The NFL team in New Orleans, let's face it, is an even bigger tease than the ladies who do the stroll on Bourban Street. Fool us 101 times and shame on you. Fool us 102 times and, well, you know. There can be no viable excuse from New Orleans players for what transpired in Sun Devil Stadium.\nOn the flip side, congrats to coach Denny Green on his first victory with the Cardinals, and to \n for his first career pass attempt, which went for a touchdown.\nOur final thought on the Saints: That was a lot of manure quarterback \n was shoveling when he cryptically suggested that he was sick of his team's inconsistency and that changes might have to be made. He was certainly right about the last part. Maybe it's time the Saints brass, which has been flirting with the idea of a contract extension for Brooks, tries to find a better option at the position once this season ends.\nTime to turn to Priest\n\nJust a suggestion but, if the \n want to have a chance at Baltimore in the Monday night game, they need a Priest, or at least more of him. It's often forgotten that, in 1999, a year before \n arrived on the scene, \n salvaged the Ravens' running game by rushing for 1,000-plus yards. When the Ravens chose Lewis, they didn't try to keep Holmes around, and he signed with the Chiefs almost as a free agency afterthought.\nThe point is that the prideful Holmes, a real warrior, is apt to be pretty passionate about the prime-time matchup with his former employers. Much has been made of the perception Holmes isn't getting as many \"touches\" from scrimmage this season. In truth, he has more rushes this season through three games (74 for 351 yards) than he did at the same point in the '03 campaign (62 carries for 296 yards). Where the Chiefs perhaps haven't gotten Holmes the ball nearly enough is in the passing game. He has only five receptions this year for 14 yards, with a long catch of just 6 yards. This time a year ago, Holmes had 13 catches for 171 yards.\nMuch of the thrust of the Chiefs' passing game in recent seasons, when the wide receivers were just about as invisible as they are now, was getting the ball to Holmes in the flat. He is a splendid receiver, a guy who can make the first defender miss when out in space and turn a swing pass into a long gain. Time to get back to that formula, it seems, if the Chiefs are going to get back to the business of winning.\nPunts:\n\n Oakland kicker \n missed a 35-yard field goal try Sunday. Remarkably, he had converted 40 straight kicks from inside 45 yards. ... Indianapolis kicker \n suffered a strained groin in Sunday's game and, at one point, was replaced on kickoffs by punter \n. Had the Colts needed to try a field goal from more than about 35 yards, it is doubtful Vanderjagt could have done it. Indy may have to sign another place kicker this week as insurance. ... Philadelphia defensive end \n notched a sack Sunday. If that doesn't seem like much, consider this: It was his first full sack since his '01 rookie season. Burgess played in just one game in 2002-03 because of foot injuries that nearly ended his career. He had a half-sack earlier this season, but got an individual quarterback kill in the victory over the Bears. ... In his emotional return to Tampa Bay, where he played 11 seasons before being cut, Denver strong safety \n had seven tackles in the win over the Bucs. ... Although the Jaguars chose not to make any hasty pronouncements on the knee injury suffered by \n, the starting left tackle is done for the year with at least one torn ligament. That means veteran \n, the former Atlanta and Denver starter signed in the spring as an  insurance policy, becomes the starter. ... Texans linebacker Jamie Sharper had a standout performance Sunday with 10 tackles, one sack, a forced fumble and a 16-yard touchdown return of a recovered fumble. ... Miami cornerback \n on the team's miserable 0-4 start: \"Things aren't going how we expected them to go, and 0-4 around here is taboo. If we don't stand together, we might as well give our helmets to the United Way.\" ... Pittsburgh tailback \n now has 18 carries for just 22 yards, but five rushing touchdowns. His scores, after notching two more touchdowns Sunday, are for 1, 1, 1, 2 and 1 yards. Bettis' longest carry of the season is for 7 yards. Of his 18 rushes, 11 are for 1 yard or less. ... The new coaches have a combined record of 12-15 so far, and Jim Mora (Atlanta) and Tom Coughlin (\n) have seven of the wins between them. ... Falcons defensive end \n had two more sacks Sunday, giving him a league-high seven through four games. The Falcons, by the way, are 4-0 for the first time since 1986. ... New England quarterback \n now has at least two touchdown passes in nine straight road games. ... Tampa Bay has lost 10 of its last 13 games. ... Filling in for injured \n (sternum), \n completed 39 passes for Tennessee but averaged just 7.1 yards per completion.", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1894615"}
